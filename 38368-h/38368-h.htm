<h2>A KNIGHT ON WHEELS</h2>

<p class="indent">&nbsp;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<p class="h3">ENVIRONMENT</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span> morning was always an interesting
time for Philip, for it was on that day that he
received letters from ladies.</p>

<p class="indent">On Mondays he used to write to them, from the
dictation of Uncle Joseph. On Tuesdays he had
an easy time of it, for Uncle Joseph was away all
day, interviewing East End vicars, and Salvation
Army officials, and editors of newspapers which
made a speciality of discriminating between genuine
and bogus charities. Uncle Joseph was a well-known
figure in the philanthropic world,&mdash;that
part of it which works without limelight and spends
every penny it receives upon relieving distress,
and knows nothing of Charity Balls and Grand
Bazaars, with their incidental expenses and middlemen's
profits,&mdash;and it was said that no deserving
case was ever brought to his notice in vain.
He would serve on no committees, and his name
figured on no subscription list; but you could be
quite certain that when Uncle Joseph wrote a
cheque that cheque relieved a real want; for he
had an infallible nose for an impostor and a most
uncanny acquaintance with the habits and customs
of the great and prosperous brotherhood of professional
beggars.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
Hard-worked curates and overdriven doctors,
who called&mdash;and never in vain&mdash;at the snug but
unpretentious house in Hampstead on behalf of
some urgent case, sometimes wondered, as they
walked away with a light heart and a heavy pocket,
what Uncle Joseph was worth; for it was said by
those who were supposed to know that his benefactions
ran into four figures annually. As a matter
of fact his income from all sources was exactly
seven hundred and fifty pounds a year, and none
of this was spent on charity.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph had one peculiarity. He transacted
no business with the female sex. If help was required
of him, application must be made by a man.</p>

<p class="indent">On Wednesdays Philip wrote&mdash;or more usually
typed&mdash;more letters, but none to ladies. On this
day he addressed himself to gentlemen, tersely
informing such that if they made search in the
envelope they would find a cheque enclosed, &quot;in
aid of the most excellent object mentioned in your
letter,&quot; which it would be a kindness to acknowledge
in due course. Uncle Joseph used to sign
these.</p>

<p class="indent">This brings us round to Thursday again; and,
as already indicated, this was Philip's field day.
On Thursday morning one James Nimmo, the
factotum of the establishment, used to arrive
shortly after breakfast in a cab, from an excursion
into regions unknown, with quite a budget of
letters. They were all from ladies, and were replies
to Philip's letters of Monday. Most of them contained
cheques, chaperoned by lengthy screeds;
some enclosed lengthy screeds but no cheques;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
while a few, written in a masculine hand, stated
briefly that &quot;If my wife is pestered in this fashion
again,&quot; Yours Faithfully proposed to communicate
with the police.</p>

<p class="indent">Although these letters were all addressed to
Philip, Uncle Joseph opened them himself, ticking
off the cheques and postal orders and dictating the
names and addresses of their senders to Philip,
who posted them up in a big book.</p>

<p class="indent">On Fridays Philip wrote acknowledging the
letters. For a boy of fourteen he was a very fair
stenographer, and could take down the sentences
almost as quickly as Uncle Joseph could dictate
them. His typing, too, was almost first-class, and
he possessed the useful, if risky, accomplishment
of being able to write two separate and distinct
hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Saturday was a particularly delightful day, for
then Uncle Joseph and Philip put all business cares
behind them and held high revel. Sometimes they
went up the River; sometimes they went to Lords;
and sometimes they took the train into the country
and tramped over the Hog's Back or the South
Downs.</p>

<p class="indent">It was upon these occasions that Uncle Joseph
would discourse upon Woman, and wonder, with
Philip, why she had been sent into the world.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There appears to be no parallel to the female
mind,&quot; Uncle Joseph would say, &quot;in any of the
works of nature. It seems almost incredible that
God should invent such a wonderful piece of
mechanism as Man&mdash;invent him for the express
purpose of controlling and developing this marvellous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
world of ours&mdash;and then deliberately stultify
his own work and handicap his own beautifully
designed and perfectly balanced engines by linking
them up with others which are conspicuous for
nothing but bias and instability. What a world
this might have been, Philip, if <i>all</i> its inhabitants
had been constructed upon a rational plan, instead
of only one half! Why is it, I wonder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, who could not remember having spoken
to a woman for ten years, except once or twice across
a counter, would shake his head despondingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put it another way,&quot; continued Uncle Joseph.
&quot;What master-mariner, having set up a carefully
designed, perfectly balanced compass upon the
bridge of his ship, would then proceed to surround
that compass&mdash;upon the steadiness of which the
very life of the ship depends&mdash;with a casual collection
of bar-magnets or soft iron bolts? What
compass could be expected to point to the Magnetic
North for one moment in such a field of
force? It would not even be a constant field of
force; for the magnets would come and go, or at
least wax and wane in attractive power, altering
the resultant intensity from year to year&mdash;from
day to day, even. No compass could give a true
bearing under such circumstances. And yet the
Supreme Architect of the Universe has done that
to us! He creates man, and having set him to
direct the course of this planet, surrounds him with
women! Why, Philip? Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this Philip would endeavour to look as wise
as possible, but once more would find himself
unable to contribute to the debate.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
Uncle Joseph would nod his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right, Philip,&quot; he would say. &quot;We don't
know why, and we never shall. All we can do is
to bow to God's will, accept the situation, and
adopt the best means at our disposal of mitigating
our disabilities. There is only one thing to do.
What is it, Philip?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip was always quite ready this time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Avoid women,&quot; he would reply gravely, &quot;at
all times and in all places.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After that they would talk about bird-migration,
or high-tension magnetos&mdash;subjects affording
easier and more profitable ground for speculation.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">On the particular Thursday morning with which
we are dealing, Philip and Uncle Joseph sat in the
library prepared for business. Philip was installed
at the broad writing-table, with a reporter's notebook
and a pencil. Beside him, ready for use,
stood the typewriter. Uncle Joseph sprawled for
the moment in an easy-chair, industriously perusing
a copy of the current issue of the &quot;Searchlight,&quot;
a weekly organ whose editor possessed an
almost indecent acquaintance with the private
lives of most of the rogues and quacks who batten
upon the British Public. He even went so far as
to publish an annual list of their names, aliases,
and addresses. Uncle Joseph had figured therein
more than once, but not as Uncle Joseph.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a knock at the door, and James
Nimmo entered, carrying a cowhide bag. This he
opened, and poured its contents upon the table&mdash;letters
of every shape, size, colour, and scent.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
&quot;A heavy post this week, James Nimmo,&quot;
commented Uncle Joseph.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mph'm,&quot; replied James Nimmo (who was a
Scotsman). &quot;Could I get speaking with you,
Colonel?&quot; he added. He called Uncle Joseph
&quot;Colonel&quot; because he was a colonel.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph looked up sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything wrong?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">James Nimmo looked at him, and like the Eldest
Oyster, shook his heavy head. Uncle Joseph
rightly took this to be a sign of assent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At Commercial Road.&quot; (As a matter of fact
James Nimmo said &quot;Commaircial Rod,&quot; but it
will be simpler to transcribe as we go.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expected it,&quot; said Uncle Joseph. He held up
the &quot;Searchlight.&quot; &quot;These people say they have
been making enquiries. Listen.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>Do any of my readers happen to know anything of the
Reverend Aubrey Buck? He appears to be devoting his
undoubted talents to the furtherance of a crusade against
what he calls &quot;The Popish Invasion of the English Home&quot;;
and to that end he is circularising the country with a passionate
appeal for funds. A copy of this appeal has been
forwarded to me by a correspondent. The head offices of the
Anti-Popery League (from which this document emanates)
are situated at 374a Commercial Road. Noting this illuminating
fact, and failing to find any reference to the
establishment in the Post-Office Directory, I last week
despatched a representative to the Commercial Road, to
seek out and interrogate the Anti-Popish Buck. As I
expected, 374a Commercial Road proved to be a small
greengrocer's shop&mdash;an &quot;accommodation address&quot; of
the most ordinary type&mdash;whose proprietor admitted that</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
<i>he was in the habit of taking in letters on behalf of some of
his customers, but declined any further information. Enthusiastic
but credulous Protestants should therefore be on
their guard. The Reverend Aubrey is evidently an experienced
hand, for his dupes are most judiciously selected,
being entirely maiden ladies of independent means and
advanced Evangelical views. From his epistolary style I
cherish a shrewd suspicion that Aubrey is nearly related
to my old friend Howard Glennie (&quot;Searchlight&quot; Rogues'
Catalogue, No. 847), who&mdash;</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Man, he's a marvel, yon felly!&quot; observed
James Nimmo admiringly. He was referring apparently
to the editor of the &quot;Searchlight.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>&mdash;Who, not long ago, as regular students of the &quot;Searchlight&quot;
will recollect, spent a very profitable two years raising
the small sum necessary to enable him to make provision
for his aged mother before leaving this country for
good, in order to devote his life to spiritual work in a leper
colony&mdash;a colony situated in an island so distant that I
was ultimately able to prove, to the profound chagrin of
Howard Glennie, that it did not exist at all. The name of
Aubrey Buck, I may add, not does appear in</i> &quot;Crockford.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph laid down the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what do you think of that?&quot; he enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall need to be getting another address,&quot;
replied James Nimmo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall have to drop Aubrey Buck, too,&quot;
said Uncle Joseph. &quot;However, we can't complain.
We have done pretty well out of him. Let me
think. I know! We will turn him into a retired
University Don with paralysis in both legs, who
has to do typewriting for a living. He shall send
an appeal for work to every lady novelist in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
country. Their name is legion. In nine cases out
of ten they will send money instead of manuscript.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And if they do send manuscript?&quot; enquired
James Nimmo dubiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will keep it for a week,&quot; replied Uncle
Joseph readily, &quot;and then return it, accompanied
by a manly but resigned letter announcing that
the paralysis has spread to the Don's arms as well,
and he supposes there is nothing for it now but
the workhouse. That ought to bring in a double
donation. Tell your brother to move from Commercial
Road to Islington. We have never had
an address there. Were the other places all right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">While James Nimmo proceeded with his report
Philip sorted the letters on the table. The conversation
did not interest him&mdash;he was accustomed
to it. But the editor of the &quot;Searchlight&quot; would
have appreciated it keenly.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently James Nimmo departed, and Uncle
Joseph and Philip went through their correspondence.
The letters were arranged into three heaps.
The first addressed itself to <i>Master T. Smith, care
of the Reverend Vitruvius Smith, 172 Laburnum
Road, Balham</i>. The other two were directed to
<i>The Honorary Secretary of the International Brotherhood
of Kind Young Hearts, Pontifex Mansions,
Shaftesbury Avenue</i>, and <i>The Reverend Aubrey
Buck, Head Office, The Anti-Popery League, 374a
Commercial Road</i>, respectively.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of Master T. Smith's envelopes contained
postal orders, some of them accompanied by
lengthy epistles which blended heavy-handed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
patronage and treacly sentiment in equal proportions.
Uncle Joseph read one or two aloud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>My dear little Tommy,&mdash;I feel that I must send you
something in response to your little letter, which has
touched me to the depths of my heart</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only five shillings,&quot; commented Uncle Joseph,
referring to the postal order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>I hope your father is better, and will soon be about his
parish work again. The expense of his illness must have
been very great, and I cannot wonder that you should have
overheard your mother crying in the night, when she
thought you were all fast asleep. Perhaps it was</i> wrong
<i>of you to write to me for help without consulting your
parents; but, as you point out, it would, indeed, be a
splendid surprise if you could go to your father's study
with a little money in your hand and say:&mdash;&quot;That is for
household expenses, dear Father, from an anonymous well-wisher.&quot;
I think it was clever of you to spell &quot;anonymous&quot;
correctly.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was infernally silly of you,&quot; amended Uncle
Joseph, looking up for a moment. &quot;However:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>I feel therefore that I must fall in with your little plot.
I am not allowed by law to send actual coin through the
post, or you should have had a bright new five-shilling
piece.</i> [This woman ought to be put into a Home.] <i>So I
enclose what is called a postal order. If you sign your
name on it and take it round to the nearest Post-Office,
they will give you five shillings in exchange.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Do not apologise for your handwriting. I think it is quite
good for a boy of ten. Give my love to your baby brother.</i></p>

<p class="signature"><i>Your sincere friend,</i></p>

<p class="author"><i>Jane Roper.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>P.S. I wonder how you heard of me.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
&quot;They all want to know that,&quot; grunted Uncle
Joseph. &quot;None of the silly creatures seem ever
to have heard of directories.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Master Thomas Smith gravely signed the postal
order which Uncle Joseph had pushed over to him,
remarking that it was a good thing Miss Roper had
not filled up the name of the post-office.</p>

<p class="indent">There were fifteen more letters in a very similar
strain. They were not all read right through, but
the name and address of the sender were always
entered in the book and the postal orders were
carefully extracted and filed.</p>

<p class="indent">Their total value was found to be seven pounds
ten&mdash;this despite a disappointment caused by the
last letter in the heap, which bore a small coronet
on the back and promised a cheque at least. It
ran:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>My dear little boy,&mdash;I read your letter with great interest
and indignation. It only proves what I have</i> always
<i>said, that some of our noble clergy are shamefully underpaid.
I do not send you any money, for to do so would be
to insult a sacred profession, and I am quite sure that your
little plan of offering a contribution of your own towards
your household expenses, though creditable to your feelings,
would meet with your dear father's deepest disapproval.
I will do better than that. I have some little influence with
the kind Bishop of your diocese, and if you will send me
your father's full name and the name of his church and
parish,&mdash;all I have at present is your home address,&mdash;I
will make strong representations to His Lordship on
your behalf. Indeed, I expect to meet him at dinner next
week. I have been unable to verify your father's name in</i>
&quot;Crockford's Clerical Directory,&quot; <i>which I always keep
by me. But you see, there are so many Smiths</i>&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
&quot;Quite so,&quot; murmured Uncle Joseph, in tones
of deep satisfaction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>&mdash;And the task is too difficult. However, if you will
send me the details I ask for, I feel sure that the dear Bishop
will make a searching enquiry into your father's case.</i></p>

<p class="signature"><i>Your affectionate friend,</i></p>

<p class="author"><i>Sarah Brickshire.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>P.S. I wonder how such a little boy as you found out
my address.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Interfering old tabby!&quot; observed Uncle Joseph
testily. &quot;If she persists in this preposterous nonsense
we shall have to change your <i>venue</i>, Philip.
Now for the Kind Young Hearts!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To judge by the contents of the second heap of
envelopes, the International Brotherhood of Kind
Young Hearts was an institution of variegated
aims and comfortable income. A five-pound note
dropped out of the first letter opened, the sender,
in her covering epistle, expressing her warm admiration
for the character of a heroic (but unfortunately
fictitious) individual named Dimitri
Papodoodlekos,&mdash;or something to that effect,&mdash;an
Armenian gentleman of enlightened views and
stiff moral fibre, who, having been converted late
in life to the principles of Wesleyan Methodism,
had persisted, in the very heart of the Ottoman
Empire and in the face of all Islam, in maintaining
and practising the tenets of his newly embraced
creed until summarily deported from his native
Armenia by direction of the Sultan himself. The
writer begged to enclose a small contribution towards
the sum of fifty pounds which she understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
the Brotherhood of Kind Young Hearts was
endeavouring to raise in order to set up the expatriated
Papodoodlekos in a cigar-divan in Stoke
Newington.</p>

<p class="indent">The next letter contained a postal order for one
pound, contributed by a warm-hearted but gullible
female in Leicestershire, as a contribution towards
the sum required to purchase a dress-suit for
Samuel Mings, the Walthamstow garotter, who,
having recently completed a term of fifteen years'
penal servitude, was now anxious to atone for
past misdeeds by plunging into a life of intense
respectability. Samuel, it seemed, had decided
to follow the calling of a waiter at suburban dinner-parties;
and, being a man of agreeable address and
imposing appearance, had already booked several
conditional engagements in the Golder's Green
district. A second-hand dress-suit was now all that
was requisite to ensure for him a permanent residence
in the paths of virtue.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be mentioned here that sufficient cash
to equip Samuel with an entire Bond Street <i>trousseau</i>
was yielded by this post alone.</p>

<p class="indent">But the begging-letter writer, charm he never
so wisely, draws a blank sometimes. Presently
Uncle Joseph picked up a large grey envelope from
the heap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Man's handwriting,&quot; he observed.</p>

<p class="indent">From the envelope he extracted a letter and
a cheque. A casual glance at the face of the
cheque caused him to raise his eyebrows comically
and whistle. Then he skimmed through the
letter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
&quot;Here's a fellow with a sense of humour,&quot; he
said. &quot;What a tonic after all these women!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>Sir,&mdash;My wife, who occasionally permits me to take
charge of her correspondence (especially when she is asked
for money), has handed me your very interesting communication.
I learn from it that the International Brotherhood
of Kind Young Hearts is in need of funds for fifteen different
objects&mdash;prettily described by you as &quot;this week's
List of Mercy.&quot; The list includes:&mdash;</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>(1) Appeal on behalf of an Armenian undesirable, who
appears to have evaded the Immigration Laws of this
country and so planted himself in our unhappy midst.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>(2) Appeal on behalf of a retired garotter, who, before
setting up in business as a suburban burglar, evidently
desires to study the architecture and internal arrangements
of the residences of our wealthy</i> bourgeoisie.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>(3) Appeal for a sum sufficient to send one thousand slum
children to the seaside.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>This appears to be a laudable object, though it is perhaps
undesirable to despatch children of that age and condition to
the seaside in early December, as you apparently propose to
do. It would, moreover, have established greater confidence
in the minds of your clients if you had mentioned the name
of the slum, the name of the watering-place to which you
propose to send the children, and the nature of your arrangements
for conveying and maintaining them there. If I may
say so, there is a lack of names, places, and figures in your
scheme. But perhaps, as in the case of John Wesley, &quot;the
world is your parish.&quot;</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>There are twelve other appeals of a similar nature, all
equally hard to resist and all equally entertaining. Subscribers,
I note, are requested to place a mark opposite to
the particular item of your programme to which they wish
their contribution to be devoted. I confess I find my sympathy
excited less by some of the appeals than by the others.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
<i>For instance, I fear I cannot support your view of the
desirability of providing a one-armed protégé of yours,
Albert Edward Skewby, with a hurdy-gurdy. In my opinion
there are only two musicians in history&mdash;Bach and
Tchaikowsky&mdash;and neither of these sounds to advantage
on a hurdy-gurdy. Besides, Albert probably has another
arm inside his waistcoat. You look and see. Neither can I
find it in my heart to support your Home of Rest for unwanted
Doggies. Sausages are dear enough as it is, and if
you are going to corner the market in this well-meaning but
misguided fashion, I fear they will soon be out of my reach
altogether.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>However, some of your other appeals moved me deeply,
and I confess I have experienced great difficulty in making
my final choice. I was strongly attracted at first by the case
of the gentleman who has just terminated a protracted visit
to an inebriates' home, and who, I gather, is anxious to
raise a sum sufficient to enable him to qualify for readmission
at an early date. I nearly succumbed, again, to your
appeal on behalf of the lady who has recently been rendered
a widow by reason of the hasty and ill-considered action of a
band of African cannibals. On second thoughts, however,
remembering that the pangs of the good lady over the loss
of her husband must be as nothing in comparison with those
of the unfortunate savages who are probably still trying to
digest him, I held my hand, and passed on to my final
choice&mdash;the purchase of an annuity for the aged and
badly-used butler, Lemuel Bloote&mdash;(what fun it must be
making up names like that!)</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lemuel, I gather, has severed his connection with his
employer&mdash;a nobleman to whose family and person the
Blootes have been faithfully attached for more than forty
years&mdash;owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding with
regard to a valuable and massive service of Sheffield plate,
unaccountably missing from the baronial strong-room.
Lemuel naturally left the court without a stain upon his</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
<i>character, but wounded pride forbade him to reènter the
service of his aristocratic traducer. Too old to start life
afresh, too self-respecting to beg, he has thrown himself, you
say, upon the compassion of the International Brotherhood
of the Kind Young Hearts. I cannot resist this appeal. I
set my mark against the name of Lemuel Bloote, and beg
you to be so kind as to accept my cheque on his behalf. I do
not know how great a sum is required to purchase an annuity
for a Bloote, so I leave the cheque blank. Kindly fill it
up at your discretion. I make only one stipulation. I am a
collector of Sheffield plate. If Lemuel has not already disposed
of his stock, perhaps you will kindly put me into
direct communication with him.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Let me close with a word of advice. When you write your
next batch of appeals, do not allow your sense of humour
to run away with you altogether. I admire and respect a
cheerful knave, but let there be moderation in all things.</i></p>

<p class="signature"><i>Yours faithfully,</i></p>

<p class="author"><i>Julius Mablethorpe.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The cheque was headed <i>Bank of Expectation</i>, and
bore the somewhat unexpected signature of the
head of the house of Rothschild. It was drawn to
the order of <i>A. S. Windeller, Esq.</i>, and was dated
<i>April the First, 2013</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to meet that fellow,&quot; said Uncle
Joseph appreciatively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So should I,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">His uncle looked up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo!&quot; he said. &quot;Is your sense of humour
beginning to sprout, Philip? You are growing up,
my boy. How old are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nearly fifteen,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you don't look it, but you possess certain
attainments which a young man of thirty might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
envy. In other respects you must be considered
backward. But you are an excellent secretary, you
can keep accounts, and you are exceptionally well
up in English literature and modern science. I
have directed you to the best of my ability in the
right way of life. At any rate, I have kept you
away from wrong influences. You are healthy in
body and prompt in mind, and you are thoroughly
inoculated against the female virus. Now your
sense of humour is developing. You should go far.
But we are wasting time. Let us polish off Aubrey
Buck's correspondence, and then I will dictate to
you one or two new letters which I have drafted.
Your attention appears to be wandering. What are
you thinking about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing in particular, Uncle Joseph,&quot; said
Philip. He took up his pen briskly.</p>

<p class="indent">But for all that he <i>had</i> been thinking about
something in particular. Uncle Joseph's reference
to the female virus had brought it to his mind. It
was a little girl in a blue cotton frock.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<p class="h3">LE PREMIER PAS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Having</span> disposed of the Reverend Aubrey Buck's
correspondence,&mdash;it was not so bulky as on previous
occasions, for evidently the paragraph in the
&quot;Searchlight&quot; had dealt its originator a mortal
blow,&mdash;uncle and nephew sat down to an excellent
luncheon, cooked and served by James Nimmo.
No woman ever crossed the threshold of the house
in Hampstead.</p>

<p class="indent">James Nimmo had originally been a ship's
steward, and his conversion to misogynistic principles
had been effected comparatively late in life.
Always a man of thrifty disposition, he had shirked
the responsibility and expense of matrimony until
he had attained the ripe age of forty. Then he fell
a sudden and abject captive to the charms of a
damsel of Carnoustie, half his age. The match was
struck, but it was stipulated by the girl's parents
that the wedding should not take place until after
James Nimmo's next voyage.</p>

<p class="indent">Before sailing, the prospective bridegroom
handed over to his beloved the greater part of his
savings, to be expended in the purchase and outfitting
of a suitable establishment,&mdash;to wit, a <i>bijou</i>
villa in Broughty Ferry,&mdash;in order that the
honeymoon might commence without unavoidable
delay upon his return.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
Eight weeks later James Nimmo sailed into the
Tay, to find his turtle-dove flown. Alarmed possibly
by the unrest produced in the real property
market by recent legislation, the lady had forborne
to purchase the <i>bijou</i> villa. Having no house, to
spend money upon furniture was obviously a work
of supererogation. Lastly, inspired possibly by a
yearning for a wider field in which to exercise her
undoubted talents, the affianced of James Nimmo
had decided to emigrate to Canada. This decision
she promptly put into execution, departing without
due ostentation in the steerage of an Allan liner,
and taking with her her parents, James Nimmo's
savings, and a young carpenter of steady habits
and good wage-earning capacity whom she had
married three days previously.</p>

<p class="indent">Six months later James Nimmo made the acquaintance
of Uncle Joseph on board a P. &amp; O.
liner, homeward bound from Bombay. James was
deck-steward on that voyage, and Uncle Joseph's
attention was first attracted to him by the extreme
coldness, not to say <i>hauteur</i>, with which he attended
to the wants of seasick lady passengers.
James Nimmo on his part noted with grim approval
the whole-hearted fashion in which Uncle Joseph,
who was a presentable bachelor of thirty-six in
those days, boycotted the long row of chairs in the
lee of the deckhouses, and confined himself to the
smoking-room or the windward side of the ship.</p>

<p class="indent">One hot night in the Red Sea a chance remark of
Uncle Joseph's unlocked the heart and loosed the
tongue of James Nimmo, and before dawn the
whole of the tale of the fickle beauty of Carnoustie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
had been told, for the first and last time, to mortal
man.</p>

<p class="indent">At Tilbury James Nimmo resigned his post and
abandoned the service of the sea, in order to follow
Uncle Joseph. Since that day they had never been
parted. All this had happened more than ten
years ago.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip had been added to the household at
Hampstead a few days after Uncle Joseph had
landed at Tilbury,&mdash;in fact, it was on Philip's
account that Uncle Joseph had come home,&mdash;and
from that moment he had lived and breathed in
a society exclusively masculine. He still retained
recollections of the period when petticoats ruled
him, but they were very faint, for his nursery days
had ended abruptly at the tender age of four.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes, though, he had visions. He saw
dimly a stout, autocratic, but on the whole good-tempered
being whom he called Nanny. He saw
more dimly a big silent man, who occasionally took
him on his knee and fed him furtively with the tops
of eggs, and made laborious conversation. And
most dimly of all he saw a lady, very dainty and
sweet-smelling, who always appeared to be talking.
When she talked to a group of other ladies and
gentlemen, she seemed to smile and sparkle like
some pretty jewel. But when she was alone with
the big silent man she neither smiled nor sparkled,
and her voice sounded shrill and hard. Philip had
a vague recollection that on these occasions the
room always seemed to grow darker.</p>

<p class="indent">The pretty lady took little notice of Philip, but
Philip took sufficient notice of her to be able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
realize, one day, that she was gone. Nothing else
about the house seemed changed except that.
Philip still played in the nursery, and went out
walking with his Nanny: he even received the tops
of eggs from the big silent man, who seemed to
grow more silent and less big as the days went by.
But the pretty lady never came back. Once Philip
ventured to enquire of the Man what had become
of her, but the question was not answered, and the
Man seemed to grow even smaller than before; so
Philip, fearing lest he should fade away altogether,
refrained from further investigations.</p>

<p class="indent">Not long after this Philip was taken to see the
Man in bed, and he noted with concern that the
Man had shrunk away almost to nothing. Philip
was lifted up, and the Man kissed him, which he
had never done before, and said something which
Philip did not understand, but which made Nanny
cry. Philip cried, too, when he was taken back to
the nursery, and Nanny endeavoured to comfort
him by giving him an egg with his tea. But Philip
would only eat the top. The Man would have been
pleased if he had known this, and perhaps he did;
for during the hour of Philip's tea-time he passed
on to a place where people know everything, and&mdash;which
is far better&mdash;the reason of everything.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">After that came a period when the windows were
darkened and people came and went in great
numbers throughout the house. Philip had a new
black velvet suit, and rather enjoyed the stir and
bustle. But when this <i>émeute</i> was over the days
grew very dull, for Nanny and Philip and one or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
two maids seemed to have the house to themselves.
Everybody appeared to be waiting for something.
Even the glories of the black velvet suit began to
pall, and Philip was genuinely relieved when one
day a carriage drove up to the door and a gentleman
stepped out and rang the bell with an authoritative
peal. Most gratifying of all, the gentleman
was shown straight up to the nursery, where he
shook hands with Philip and directed him to address
him as Uncle Joseph. The gentleman strongly
resembled the Man, except that his back was
stiffer, and he held his head more proudly, and
spoke in a staccato and commanding voice.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Philip's last day in the nursery, for
Uncle Joseph took him away that very afternoon.
<i>Non sine pulvere</i>, however. For a most unexpected
and memorable conflict arose between Uncle
Joseph and Nanny. Philip, who sat on the window-seat
an interested witness, never forgot that spectacle.
He had seen Nanny cross and he had seen
Nanny cry; but he had never before seen Nanny
cross and crying at the same time. Her voice rose
higher and higher, and then broke. Philip heard
her say &quot;That lamb!&quot; several times, and Uncle
Joseph replied, in a very steady resolute voice:
&quot;Never again! Never again to one of your sex!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After that events moved rapidly, and Philip
remembered little more except a hurricane of tearful
farewells from Nanny and the maids, and a long
journey in the carriage to the house in Hampstead.
Here he was introduced to James Nimmo, who
provided him with an excellent tea, and then
washed him (with surprising skill) and put him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
bed. After a few days Philip, with the happy
adaptability of extreme youth, grew so accustomed
to his new surroundings that it would have
embarrassed him extremely to have had his face
washed by a lady.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, after ten years, the visions of his nursery
days came but rarely. The pretty lady he had
almost forgotten. Once a whiff of scent, emanating
from an <i>houri</i> who passed him in the Finchley
Road, brought her memory back to him, but only
for a moment. Poor, cross, faithful Nanny was a
mere shadow. The Man dwelt most strongly in his
recollection, but he was becoming inextricably
merged with Uncle Joseph.</p>

<p class="indent">James Nimmo and Uncle Joseph divided Philip's
upbringing between them. Uncle Joseph taught
him to read and write, while James Nimmo instructed
him in the arts of cookery and needlework.
By the time he was ten Philip could make an
omelette, repair a rent in his own garments, or
&quot;sort&quot;&mdash;to use James Nimmo's expression&mdash;a
faulty electric bell.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph broke to him the news that the
world was round, and initiated him into the mysteries
of latitude and longitude and the geography
of continents and oceans. James Nimmo's discourses
had a more human and personal touch.
He spoke of far-reaching steamer-tracks as if they
had been London thoroughfares, alluding to
mighty liners with no more emphasis than if they
had been so many motor omnibuses&mdash;as, indeed,
they are. He criticised New York, Colombo, or
Melbourne in no mere scientific spirit, but from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
the point of view of a thrifty Scot ashore for a few
hours' pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">Neither was Philip's literary education neglected.
Uncle Joseph cultivated his intellect, while
James Nimmo enriched his vocabulary. From
Uncle Joseph he learned to enjoy the masterpieces
of his native tongue, and to express himself in
direct and cogent English; but it was from James
Nimmo that he picked up such colloquial <i>patois</i>
as &quot;ashet&quot; and &quot;gigot&quot; and &quot;besom.&quot; He also
referred at times to &quot;the morn's morn,&quot; and was
accustomed to enquire of his uncle, &quot;Are you not
for another cup of tea?&quot; or, &quot;Will I open the
window?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was to James Nimmo, too, that Philip owed
his first introduction to poetry. James was in the
habit of referring constantly to a friend of his,
apparently deceased, whose full name Philip never
rightly ascertained, but whose invariable appellation
was &quot;Rabbie.&quot; &quot;Rabbie,&quot; it appeared, was
the only real poet who had ever existed. His soul
was the soul of Scotland. Rabbie had never penned
a line which did not get home to his countrymen:
conversely, no Scot could ever be overtaken by a
great thought, or conceive a moving sentiment,
without finding that thought or sentiment already
expressed, in perfection, in some work of Rabbie's.</p>

<p class="indent">James Nimmo could quote whole stanzas of him,
and kept a store of apposite tags and passages from
his works upon the tip of his tongue. He was
addicted to the recital of lengthy selections from an
intensely respectable poem entitled, &quot;The Cotter's
Saturday Night&quot;; and would throw off shorter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
masterpieces&mdash;&quot;The Twa Dogs,&quot; &quot;Scots Wha
Hae,&quot; and &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;&mdash;in their entirety.
Most of these performances Philip secretly considered
rather dull, but he made an exception in
favour of a curious little poem about a mouse,
which James Nimmo used to recite with great
tenderness and a certain pathetic effect. Our
affections must have an outlet somewhere. Old
maids cherish pug-dogs: perhaps it was the same
instinct which softened the sere and yellow heart of
James Nimmo towards the &quot;wee sleekit, cowerin',
timorous beastie,&quot; whose schemes had gone agley
too, and whose efforts to found a home for itself
had met with no better success than his own.</p>

<p class="indent">The fact that Rabbie was subject to human
weaknesses of any description, or had ever experienced
any other passions than those arising from
patriotic fervour or political animus, was concealed
from Philip for many a year. Once only did
James Nimmo lift a corner of the curtain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He went tae his grave at seven-and-thirty,&quot; he
mentioned one day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; enquired the ingenuous Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because <i>they</i> had drained the life oot o' him,&quot;
replied James Nimmo, his face hardening. &quot;I
mind a vairse he yince wrote. It micht ha' been his
ain epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&mdash;A summary of the life and character of Scotland's

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
will admit errs a little on the side of leniency towards
Rabbie and ingratitude towards a sex which,
all things considered, had no special cause to bless
him.</p>

<p class="indent">After luncheon Uncle Joseph disposed himself to
slumber for half an hour, while Philip, who in common
with his kind always felt particularly energetic
when distended with food, practised high-jumping
in the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">At two the pair went out for a walk. If it happened
to be a Thursday&mdash;as it was to-day&mdash;they
repaired to a large bank in Finchley Road, where
the notes and gold which had come out of the
morning's envelopes were handed over to a polite
cashier. Uncle Joseph was a well-known figure
here. When he strode in on Thursday afternoons
the cashier always sent a hurried message to the
manager; and that financial Janus would emerge
smiling from his temple behind the glass screens
and come round to the front of the counter and
shake hands with Uncle Joseph and engage him in
agreeable conversation, while Philip watched the
cashier licking his thumb and counting bank-notes
with incredible rapidity. After entering the numbers
of the notes in a big book the cashier would
seize the bag containing the gold and silver&mdash;quite
a number of Uncle Joseph's subscribers used
to send actual coin in registered envelopes: they
were of the type which does not understand postal
orders and mistrusts cheques&mdash;and pour it in a
jingling cascade upon the counter. Then, having
counted it by playing lightning <i>arpeggios</i> upon it
with his fingers, he would sweep it up in a brass coal-shovel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
and fling it contemptuously into a drawer
already half-full, hopelessly mixing it with other
people's money from the start. To Philip, like
most of us, banking was a mystery.</p>

<p class="indent">The manager and Uncle Joseph then shook
hands, and the proceedings terminated with a vote
of want of confidence in the weather. After that
Uncle Joseph and Philip walked to Swiss Cottage
Station, where Uncle Joseph departed alone by the
Underground&mdash;to another bank, in the Edgeware
Road this time. Here he deposited a bundle of
cheques and crossed postal orders. The majority of
these were drawn to the order of the Treasurer of
the International Brotherhood of Kind Young
Hearts, though a fair proportion bore the names
of Master T. Smith and the Reverend Aubrey
Buck.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of consideration for the manager of the bank
at Hampstead, who, had he been asked to place
sums of money intended for such a diversity of
people to the credit of a single individual, would
undoubtedly have become greatly confused,&mdash;and
deeply interested,&mdash;Uncle Joseph kept a
separate account at the Edgeware Road Bank for
all contributions to his benefactions which did not
arrive in the form of notes or cash. These he invariably
endorsed, &quot;Everard James, Secretary.&quot; The
same name was inscribed upon his pass-book. It
was understood in the Edgeware Road Bank that
Mr. James was general director of a large philanthropic
institution, and the fact that he paid in so
many cheques endorsed by other people was doubtless
due to the circumstance that these were minor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
officials of the same organization&mdash;as, indeed,
they were.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip usually devoted his solitary walk home
from Swiss Cottage Station to a minute inspection
of the shop-windows in Finchley Road. On this
particular Thursday afternoon, though, he began
to run. The soundness of his physical condition
may be gauged from the fact that he ran up Netherhall
Gardens, a declivity much in favour with
prospective purchasers of motor-cars, out on trial
trips, and in corresponding unfavour with would-be
vendors of the same&mdash;to say nothing of the
inhabitants of the Gardens.</p>

<p class="indent">He ran on past the newly built Tube Station, up
Frognal, and presently reached the outskirts of
Hampstead Heath. It was half-past three, and the
red wintry sun was sinking low.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly he paused, and then stopped dead. He
was conscious, deep down within him, of a recurrence
of the sensation which had stirred him on the
previous Sunday, as he walked over this part of the
Heath with Uncle Joseph. On that occasion he had
noticed a little girl sitting on a gate. She had
smiled at Philip as he passed&mdash;a wide and friendly
smile. Philip had not returned it, for Uncle Joseph
had noted the smile and improved the occasion at
once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, Philip?&quot; he said. &quot;The hunting instinct
already! That child has never seen you
before; she will never see you again; she would not
care if you went to perdition to-morrow, though
she would feel intensely gratified if she could be
certain that you had gone there on her account.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
She is nothing to you, or you to her. But you are a
man and she is a woman. So she smiles at you. It
is the first and most primitive of the arts of attraction.
There is nothing behind the smile&mdash;nothing
but an undeveloped predatory instinct. And that
is what Man has to struggle against all the days of
his life, to the detriment of his own and the world's
progress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Long before Uncle Joseph had concluded these
timely observations the little girl was out of sight.
&quot;Predatory&quot; was a new word to Philip. He made a
mental note of it, and resolved to question Uncle
Joseph as to its meaning on a more suitable occasion.
Meanwhile he felt that he had had an escape&mdash;an
escape and a warning.</p>

<p class="indent">Still&mdash;here he was, four days later, back on the
same dangerous spot. And there, sitting on the
same gate, with the setting sun glinting on her
long, honey-coloured pigtail, sat the little girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, boy!&quot; she said, and smiled again.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip gave her a severe look.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<p class="h3">SAMSON AND DELILAH</p>

<p class="h3">I</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> little girl continued to sit upon the top rail
of the gate, with her heels on the second and her
long black legs tucked up beneath her. She had
taken off her jacket, and was using it as a cushion
to mitigate the hardness of her perch. She was
dressed in a blue cotton frock, which was gathered
in round her waist with a shiny red leather belt.
At least Philip considered it red: the little girl
would have explained that it was <i>cérise</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">She also continued to smile. Her teeth were very
small and regular, her eyes were soft and brown,
and some of her hair had blown up across the front
of her tam-o-shanter, which matched the colour of
her belt.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip stood stock still, and surveyed her a little
less severely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, boy!&quot; said the little girl again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo!&quot; said Philip, in guarded tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw you on Sunday,&quot; the little girl informed
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said Philip coldly, and prepared
to pass on. Uncle Joseph's warning had recurred
to him with the mention of Sunday.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't go,&quot; said the small siren on the gate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I will,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip hesitated. Uncle Joseph had trained him
always to say exactly what he thought, and never
to make excuses. But he experienced a curious
difficulty in informing this little creature that he
was leaving her because she belonged to a dangerous
and unscrupulous class of the community. It
was the first stirring of chivalry within him. So he
did not reply, but began to move away, rather
sheepishly.</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl promptly unlimbered her stern-chasers,
and the scornful accusation rang out:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're shy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Into an ordinary boy such an insult would have
burned like acid. But Philip merely said to himself
thoughtfully, as he walked away:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if I <i>am</i> shy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then presently he decided:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I'm not: I can't be, because I wanted to
stay and talk to her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He walked on a few yards, and then paused
again. Boy nature, long dormant, was struggling
vigorously to the surface.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>won't</i> be called shy!&quot; he said to himself
hotly.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned and walked quickly back.</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl was still sitting on the gate, studiously
admiring the sunset. Once more Philip
stood before her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say,&quot; he said nervously, &quot;I'm not shy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl looked down languidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you come back again?&quot; she enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip, scarlet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wanted to tell you,&quot; pursued Philip doggedly,
&quot;that I wasn't shy just now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl nodded her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; she said coldly. &quot;You were not shy&mdash;only
rude. Is that it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The greater part of Philip's short life had been
spent, as the reader knows, in imbibing the principle
that a man not only may, but, if he values
his soul, must, be rude to women upon all occasions.
It is therefore regrettable to have to record
that at this point&mdash;at the very first encounter
with the enemy&mdash;Philip threw his principles
overboard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no,&quot; he said in genuine distress. &quot;I didn't
mean to be rude to you. It&mdash;it was a different
reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl made no reply for a moment, but
stood up on her heels and unrolled her cushion to
double its former width.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come up here and tell me about it,&quot; she said
maternally, patting the seat she had prepared.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip began to climb the gate. Then he deliberately
stepped down again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren't you coming?&quot; asked the little girl, with
the least shade of anxiety in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip. &quot;But I'll come up on the
other side of you. Then I shall be able to keep the
wind off you a bit. It's rather cold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And he did so. Poor Uncle Joseph!</p>

<p class="indent">Now they were on the gate together, side by side,
actually touching. Philip, feeling slightly dazed,
chiefly noted the little girl's hands, which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
clasped round her knees. His own hands were
broad, and inclined to be horny; hers were slim,
with long fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl turned to him with a quick, confiding
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now tell me why,&quot; she commanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why what?&quot; asked Philip reluctantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why you went away just now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip took a deep breath, and embarked upon
the task of relegating this small but dangerous animal
to her proper place in the Universe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was&mdash;it was what Uncle Joseph said,&quot; he
explained lamely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is Uncle Joseph?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&mdash;I live with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haven't you got a father or a mother?&quot; A pair
of very kind eyes were turned full upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor boy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To Philip's acute distress a small arm was
slipped within his own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have a father and a mother,&quot; said the little
girl. &quot;You may come and see them if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, who intended to cut the whole connection
as soon as he could decently escape from the gate,
thanked her politely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only don't come without telling me,&quot; continued
his admonitress, &quot;because Father isn't always
in a good temper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip thought he might safely promise this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now tell me what Uncle Joseph said,&quot; resumed
the little girl. &quot;What is your name?&quot; she added,
before the narrative could proceed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
&quot;Philip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philip what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philip Meldrum.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I call you Phil?&quot; enquired the lady, with
a friendly smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, please,&quot; replied Philip, feeling greatly
surprised at himself.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause. Philip became dimly conscious
that something was expected of him&mdash;something
that had nothing to do with Uncle
Joseph. He turned to his companion for enlightenment.
Her face was slightly flushed, and her eyes
met his shyly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is <i>your</i> name?&quot; he enquired cautiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marguerite Evelyn Leslie Falconer,&quot; replied
the little girl, in tones of intense relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Do they call you all that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I am usually called Peggy. Sometimes
Pegs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Falconer sighed indulgently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy is the short for Marguerite,&quot; she explained.
&quot;Didn't you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">He was about to proceed to a further confession,
when the little girl said graciously:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may call me Peggy if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here Philip, whose moral stamina seemed to be
crumbling altogether, took his second downward
step.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall call you Pegs,&quot; he said boldly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; replied the lady so designated.
&quot;Now tell me what Uncle Joseph said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
&quot;Uncle Joseph,&quot; began Philip once more, &quot;was
with me on Sunday, when you were sitting here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was I?&quot; enquired Peggy with a touch of
<i>hauteur</i>. Then she continued inconsequently: &quot;I
remember him quite well. Go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He saw you,&quot; continued the hapless Philip,
&quot;when you smiled at me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Falconer's slim body stiffened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;oh!&quot; she gasped. &quot;How can you
say such a thing? I <i>never</i> did!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Philip&mdash;who had yet to learn the lesson
that feminine indiscretions must always be accepted
without comment and never again referred
to without direct invitation&mdash;merely reiterated his
tactless statement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you did,&quot; he said. &quot;Or perhaps,&quot; he
added desperately, for Peggy's eyes were almost
tearful, &quot;you were only smiling to yourself about
something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To his profound astonishment this lame suggestion
was accepted. Miss Falconer nodded. Her
self-respect was saved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said; &quot;that was it. Go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;And when Uncle Joseph saw you smiling&mdash;to
yourself&mdash;he said that women always did
that. He said they couldn't help it. It was a&mdash;a
prebby&mdash;a prebby-something instinct. I can't
remember the word.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Presbyterian?&quot; suggested Miss Falconer helpfully.
&quot;Our cook is one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something like that. Yes, I believe it <i>was</i>
that,&quot; said Philip. He was quite sure it was not,
but he was anxious not to offend again. &quot;He said it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
was due to a&mdash;a Presbyterian instinct. He thinks
women ought to be avoided.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Peggy, deeply intrigued.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He doesn't like them,&quot; explained Philip. He
spoke quite apologetically. Half an hour ago he
could have set forth the doctrines of Uncle Joseph
as matters of fact, not of opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">But Miss Falconer did not appear to be offended.
She seemed rather pleased with Uncle Joseph.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't like them much myself,&quot; she announced.
&quot;Except Mother, of course. I like little girls best&mdash;and
then little boys.&quot; She squeezed Philip's arm
in an ingratiating manner. &quot;But why doesn't
Uncle Joseph like women? They can't do anything
to <i>him</i>! They can't stop <i>him</i> doing nice things!
They can't send <i>him</i> to bed!&quot; concluded Miss Falconer
bitterly. Evidently the memory of some
despotic nurse was rankling. &quot;Did he ever tell you
why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes&mdash;often.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does he say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He says,&quot; replied Philip, getting rapidly into
his stride over long-familiar ground, &quot;that women
are the disturbing and distracting force in Nature.
They stray deliberately out of their own appointed
sphere in order to interfere with and weaken the
driving-force of the world&mdash;Man. They are a
parry&mdash;parry&mdash;parry-sitic growth, sapping the
life out of the strongest tree. They are subject to
no standard laws, and therefore upset the natural
balance of Creation. They act from reason and not
instinct&mdash;no, I think it is the other way round&mdash;they
act from instinct and not from reason. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
have no breadth of view or sense of proportion.
They argue from the particular to the general; and
in all argument they habitually beg the question
and shift their ground if worsted. They cannot
organise or direct; they only scheme and plot.
Their own overpowering instinct is the Prebby&mdash;Presbyterian
instinct&mdash;the instinct of plunder&mdash;to
obtain from Man the wherewithal to deck
their own persons with extravagant and insanitary
finery. This they do, not to gratify man, but to
mortify one another. A man who would perform
his life's work untravelled&mdash;no, untrammelled&mdash;must
avoid women at all costs. At least,&quot; concluded
Philip traitorously, &quot;that is what Uncle
Joseph says.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Falconer puckered her small brow. Evidently
she declined to go all the way with Uncle
Joseph in his views.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't understand it all,&quot; she said frankly,
&quot;but some of it sounds pretty silly. Is your Uncle
Joseph a nice man? Do you like him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip stoutly. &quot;He is very kind to
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He sounds a funny man,&quot; mused Peggy. &quot;I
shall talk to Mother about him. I must go now. It
is getting dark.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She slipped off the gate, and Philip perceived,
for the first time, that for all her youthfulness she
was half a head taller than himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where do you live?&quot; enquired Philip, forgetting
his previous intentions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Over there, where the lamp-posts are. Goodnight,
Phil!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
&quot;Good night, Pegs!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The children shook hands gravely. Both desired
most ardently to ask the same question; but Philip
was restrained by his principles (now returning
hurriedly to duty), and Miss Peggy by maidenly
reserve. But each secretly made the same resolution
at the same moment.</p>

<p class="h3">II</p>

<p class="indent">Philip found his uncle smoking a pipe in a big
armchair before the study fire. He was jotting
down calculations on a blotting-pad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The opposite sex has its uses, Philip,&quot; he said.
&quot;To-day, thanks to the sentimental credulity of a
number of estimable but credulous females, we
have raked in forty-seven pounds ten. With that
sum we shall be able to do some real good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are you going to spend it this week,
Uncle Joseph?&quot; asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Considering the season of the year, I think the
best thing I can do is to devote practically all of it
to Christmas benevolences&mdash;chiefly of the coal-and-blanket
order. I have no quarrel with the very
young, and I don't like to think of any child, male
or female, going hungry or cold on Christmas Day.
You can do a lot with forty-seven pounds ten,
Philip. For about fourpence you can distend a
small stomach to its utmost capacity, and you can
wrap it up and keep it warm for very little more.
What a blessed thing it is that these misguided
females have some one to divert their foolish offerings
into wise channels. This very week, but for us,
forty-seven pounds ten would have dropped into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
the banking-account of some professional beggar,
or gone to bolster up some perfectly impossible
enterprise, such as the overthrow of the Church of
Rome or the conversion of the Jews.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph laughed whimsically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is a touch of humour about it all,&quot; he
said. &quot;It would appeal to the editor of the 'Searchlight.'
I must tell him all about it some day&mdash;when
I go out of business! Yes, we'll stick to coal-and-blanket
charities at present, Philip. After
Christmas I want to tackle the question of emigration
again. Now get your writing-pad. I want
to dictate rough copies of the letters for next
Monday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph filled a fresh pipe, and began to
stimulate his epistolary faculties by walking about
the room. Philip silently took his seat at the
table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aubrey Buck must go,&quot; was Uncle Joseph's
first announcement. &quot;Let us make a start upon
his successor. His name shall be Arthur Brown,
M.A., late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
Trinity is so big that it is very hard to trace all its
late Fellows, especially if their name is Brown.
John's is good, too, but we did very well with a
Johnian missionary to Central Patagonia a couple
of years ago, and we must divide our favours
impartially. Now, take this down:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;<i>Dear Madam,&mdash;Not long ago I was like yourself&mdash;a
personality in the world of letters. Not of letters such as
this, which (between you and I) it is with the utmost repugnance
that I have brought myself to sit down and address to
a fellow-scribe</i>&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
&quot;That's a purposely turgid and ungrammatical
sentence, but she won't know. It does me good to
dictate it&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;&mdash;<i>but of the great world of Literature, where the rarest
spirits assemble and meet together</i>&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's out of the Prayer Book, and fits in
rather well there&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;&mdash;<i>spirits that live as gods, and take sweet counsel together.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;That last bit is King David, but she will probably
think it is Ella Wheeler Wilcox&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;<i>The busy life that you lead, as one of the protagonists
of modern thought</i>&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;She won't know what a protagonist is, but it
will please her to be called one&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;&mdash;<i>deprives me of the hope that you can possibly have found
time to glance through my poor works. Yet, believe me, even
I have had my little circle. I, too, have walked in the
groves of the Academy with my cluster of disciples, striving
to contribute my mite to the sum-total of our knowledge.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now we might come to the point, I think&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;<i>But my course is run; my torch extinguished. Two years
ago I was attacked by paralysis of the lower limbs</i>&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Always say 'lower limbs' when talking to a
lady, Philip&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;&mdash;<i>lower limbs, followed by general prostration of the entire
system. I am now sufficiently recovered to don my armour
once more; but alas! my occupation is gone. My Fellowship
expired six months ago, and has not been renewed. My
pupils are dispersed to the corners of the earth. Entirely</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
<i>without private means, I have migrated to London, where
I am endeavouring to eke out an existence in a populous
but inexpensive quarter of the town&mdash;the existence of a
retired scholar and gentleman, save the mark!&mdash;</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's a good touch, Philip!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;<i>&mdash;by clerical work.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, don't put that. She will think clerical
means something to do with the Church. Say
'secretarial' instead&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;<i>Have you any typing you could give me to do? I hate
asking, and I know that you know I hate asking; but there
is a subconscious, subliminal bond, subjective and objective,&mdash;</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know what that means, but it sounds
splendid&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;<i>&mdash;that links together all brothers of the pen; and I venture
to hope that in appealing to you, of all our great brotherhood,
I shall not appeal in vain.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;We had better wind up with a classical quotation
of some kind,&quot; concluded Uncle Joseph. &quot;She
will expect it from a Don with paralytic legs, I
fancy. Reach me down that Juvenal, Philip. I
have a notion. Yes, here we are:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;<i>Possibly you may ask, and ask with justice, why the
University has done nothing for me. I did make an appeal
to the authorities; but&mdash;well, a man hates to have to appeal
twice for a thing that should by rights be granted without
appeal at all; and I desisted. The University is rich and
respectable; I am worn-out and shabby. What could I do?</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>Plurima sunt quæ<br />
Non homines audent pertusa dicere læna.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
&quot;Get that down right, Philip. She may take it
to some educated person to get it translated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does it mean, Uncle Joseph?&quot; asked
Philip, carefully copying out the tag.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It means, roughly, that a man with patches on
his trousers cannot afford to ask for much. Now
to wind up:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;<i>So I pray you&mdash;not of your charity, but of your good-comradeship&mdash;to
send me a little work to do. The remuneration
I leave to you. I am too destitute&mdash;and perhaps
too proud&mdash;to drive a bargain.</i></p>

<p class="signature"><i>Yours fraternally,</i></p>

<p class="author"><i>Arthur Brown.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put 'Late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.'
You can add the Islington address when
James Nimmo has fixed it up. Then type it out.
Do about seventy copies. I have been going
through the lady members of the Authors' Society,
and have picked out most of its female geniuses.
Now for next week's list for the Kind Young
Hearts! Three or four of the old items can stand&mdash;particularly
Papodoodlekos: he is a very lucrative
old gentleman&mdash;but the others must come
out. I shall not send the revised list, though, to
your friend&mdash;what was that humourist's name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Julius Mablethorpe,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's the man. Now I think of it, I have read
some novels by him. I shall not send him the
revised list, but I am grateful to him, all the same,
for one or two useful hints. That scheme for sending
children to the seaside ought not to have gone
in at this time of year. The foolishness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
average female philanthropist is so stupendous that
one grows careless. Instead, we will substitute a
League of Playground Helpers&mdash;a band of interfering
young women whose primary act of officiousness
shall be to invade the East End and instruct
slum-children in the art of playing games scientifically
and educatively. There's a great rage for that
sort of thing just now, though how one can make a
mud-pie, or play hop-scotch, or throw kittens into a
canal scientifically and educatively beats me. Still,
the idea is good for a few postal orders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The list was completed, to a running accompaniment
of this sort, and Philip began to put
away his writing materials.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph glanced at the clock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is just time for one more letter before
dinner,&quot; he said. &quot;I am going to ring the changes
on Tommy Smith a trifle. Next week, I think,
instead of writing to grown-ups, he must send an
ill-spelt but touching appeal to some little girls.
About a dozen will do&mdash;the children of wealthy or
titled widows. The difficulty will be to get hold
of the brats' Christian names. However, we will
work it somehow. We might say 'Little Miss So-and-So,'
or, 'The Little Girl who lives with Mrs.
So-and-So.' Either will look childish and pretty.
Just take this down, and we'll see how it sounds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>&quot;Dear Little Girl,&mdash;I am only a little boy about your
age, and my Daddy does not know I am writing to you.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put in spelling mistakes as usual.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>&quot;My Daddy is a curate. We are very poor, and he has
been ill for months. I often hear my mother crying in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
night, when she thinks we are all in bed asleep. I have no
sister of my own&mdash;only a little baby brother. How I wish
you were my sister. Then you might help me to earn some
money for my father. Shall we pretend to be brother and
sister, and then&mdash;</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Philip, old man. Getting tired?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip had stopped writing. He was gazing dully,
fixedly, and rebelliously at the paper before him.
His pencil dropped from his fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">For nearly three years he had been a faithful
secretary and a willing amanuensis. He had performed
his duties mechanically, without even considering
the morality of his conduct or the feelings
of his correspondents. Now, suddenly, he hated
Uncle Joseph and all his works.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; he wondered.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<p class="h3">HEREDITY</p>

<p class="h3">I</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> Tuesday morning Uncle Joseph went away to
the City as usual, and Philip was left to his own
devices. Monday had been a heavy day, for all the
new appeals had been copied out and sent off. All,
that is, except three. Master T. Smith's elaborately
ill-spelt epistles required time for their composition,
and each, of course, had to be copied out
by hand, for it was not to be supposed that the
Smiths possessed a typewriter. So when after
breakfast Uncle Joseph discovered on the bureau
three stamped and addressed envelopes still
awaiting enclosures, he directed Philip to indite
three further copies of Master T. Smith's celebrated
appeal for a little sister, and post them with
the others.</p>

<p class="indent">When Uncle Joseph had gone, Philip set about
his task, but with no great zest. As a rule he took
a professional pride in his duties, and moreover extracted
a certain relish from his uncle's literary
audacities. The reader will possibly have noted
that at this period of his career Philip's sense of
humour was much more highly developed than his
sense of right and wrong. But during the past few
days something very big had been stirring within
him. Some people would have called it the voice of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
conscience&mdash;that bugbear of our otherwise happy
childhood. Others would have said with more
truth that it was Heredity struggling with Environment.
As a matter of fact it was the instinct of
Chivalry, which, despite the frantic assurances of a
certain section of our sisters that they stand in no
need of it, still lingers shyly in the hearts of men&mdash;a
survival from the days when a woman admitted
frankly that her weakness was her strength, and it
was a knight's glory and privilege to devote such
strength as he possessed to the protection of that
weakness.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip no longer found himself in sympathy with
Uncle Joseph's enterprises. It was not the enterprises
themselves to which he objected, for he
realized that no one was a penny the worse for
them, while many were considerably the better.
But all the newly awakened heart of this small
knight of ours rebelled against the idea of imposing
upon a woman. Philip felt that Uncle Joseph must
be wrong about women. They could not be what
he thought them&mdash;at least, not all of them. And
even if Uncle Joseph were right in his opinion,
Philip felt positive of one thing, and that was that
no woman, however undeserving, should ever be
hardly treated or made to suffer for her own shortcomings.
And to this view he held tenaciously for
the whole of his life.</p>

<p class="indent">At the present moment it caused him acute unhappiness
to be compelled to sit down and pen sloppy
effusions to little girls with whom he was not acquainted,
asking them to be so good as to consent
to become his sisters, or as an alternative send a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
postal order by return. But he was loyal to the
hand that fed him and to the man who had been
his father and his mother for the greater part of
his little life. He wrote on, steadily and conscientiously,
until the three letters were copied out and
ready for the post.</p>

<p class="indent">But it is impossible to do two things at once.
You cannot, for instance, write begging letters and
think of blue cotton frocks simultaneously. In
copying out the last letter, Philip, owing to the fact
that his wits were wandering on Hampstead Heath
instead of directing his pen, was guilty of a clerical
error.</p>

<p class="indent">The residence of Master Thomas Smith, it may
be remembered, was situated at 172 Laburnum
Road, Balham, though overzealous philanthropists,
bent upon a personal investigation into the sad
circumstances of the Smith family, might have
experienced some difficulty in piercing its disguise
as a small tobacconist's shop. Now Philip, instead
of writing out this address at the head of the sheet
of dingy Silurian notepaper upon which T. Smith
was accustomed to conduct his correspondence,
absent-mindedly wrote &quot;Holly Lodge, Hampstead,
N.W.&quot;&mdash;a <i>lapsus calami</i> which was destined to
alter the whole course of his life, together with that
of Uncle Joseph, besides bringing about the dissolution
of an admirably conducted little business in
the begging-letter line.</p>

<p class="indent">After this he folded the letter and fastened it up
in the last envelope (which, by the way, was
addressed to</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The Little Girl</i></span><br />
<span class="i2"><i>Who lives with</i></span><br />
<span class="i4"><i>Lady Broadhurst</i></span><br />
<span class="i6"><i>Plumbley Royal</i></span><br />
<span class="i8"><i>Hants)</i>,</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&mdash;and sat down to luncheon. It was a cold and
clammy meal, for it was washing-day, and the only
hot thing in the house was James Nimmo, who,
in the depths below, entangled in a maze of moist
and clinging draperies, was groping blasphemously
in the copper for the bluebag. Washing-day was
James Nimmo's day of humiliation. Uncle Joseph
had offered more than once to have the work sent
out to a laundry, but James Nimmo persisted in
doing it himself, though the lamentable behaviour
of the maids next door, what time he hung the
crumpled result of his labours out upon the drying-green,
galled him to the roots of his being.</p>

<p class="indent">After luncheon Philip, calling downstairs
through a cloud of steam that he was going out to
the post, took up the letters and his cap and ran
out of the house, down the short gravel-sweep, and
up the road.</p>

<p class="indent">Twenty minutes later he might have been
observed diligently scouring Hampstead Heath in
search of a blue cotton frock and a <i>cérise</i> leather
belt.</p>

<p class="h3">II</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Phil!&quot; remarked Miss Falconer, hastily
crumpling up her handkerchief into a moist ball
and stuffing it into her pocket. Her back had been
turned, and she had not noticed his approach.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
Philip climbed up on the gate beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me what you have been doing since I saw
you last,&quot; commanded Peggy briskly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been helping Uncle Joseph,&quot; said Philip,
rather reluctantly. He was not anxious to be drawn
into details upon this topic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Uncle Joseph?&quot; The little girl nodded her head
with an air of great wisdom. &quot;I have been talking
to Mother about him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you tell her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told her what you told me, about his not liking
women; and I asked her why she thought it
was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did she say?&quot; enquired Philip, much
interested. Of late he had been giving this point a
good deal of consideration himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She said,&quot; replied Peggy, evidently quoting
<i>verbatim</i> and with great care, &quot;that there was
probably only one woman in the world who could
give an answer to that question&mdash;and she never
would!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does that mean?&quot; enquired the obtuse
Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It means,&quot; explained Peggy, adopting the
superior attitude inevitable in the female, however
youthful, who sets out to unfold the mysteries of
the heart to a member of the unintelligent sex,
&quot;that Uncle Joseph was once fond of a lady, and
she threw him over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I don't think that can be true,&quot; said Philip
deferentially. &quot;Uncle Joseph isn't fond of any
ladies at all. You have only to hear him talk about
them to know that. He thinks they are an incu&mdash;incu&mdash;something.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
Anyhow, it means a heavy
burden. They are Parry-sites, too. He says the
only way to do one's work in life is to keep away
from women. How could he be fond of one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect he didn't always think all those
things about them,&quot; replied Peggy shrewdly.
&quot;Men change with disappointment,&quot; she added,
with an air of profound wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know that?&quot; enquired Philip respectfully.
Such matters were too high for him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have often heard Mother say so,&quot; explained
Peggy, &quot;after Father has been in one of his
tempers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip pondered. Here was a fresh puzzle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can your father have been disappointed?&quot;
he asked. &quot;He is married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn't about being married that he was
disappointed,&quot; said Peggy. &quot;You can be disappointed
about other things, you know,&quot; she
explained indulgently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Haven't you ever been disappointed
yourself? Wanting to go to a party, and not being
allowed to at the last minute, and all that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; agreed Philip. &quot;Not parties, but
other things. But I didn't know grown-up people
could be disappointed about anything. I thought
they could do anything they liked.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hitherto Philip, simple soul, had regarded disappointment
and hope deferred as part of the necessary
hardships of youth, bound to melt away in
due course, in company with toothache, measles,
tears, treats, early bedtimes, and compulsory education,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
beneath the splendid summer sun of incipient
manhood. Most of us cherish the same illusion;
and the day upon which we first realise that
quarrels and reconciliations, wild romps and reactionary
dumps, big generous impulses and little
acts of petty selfishness, secret ambitions and passionate
longings, are not mere characteristics of
childhood, to be abandoned at some still distant
milestone, but will go on with us right through life,
is the day upon which we become grown up.</p>

<p class="indent">To some of us that day comes early, and whenever
it comes it throws us out of our stride&mdash;sometimes
quite seriously. But in time, if we are of the
right metal, we accept the facts of the situation,
shake ourselves together, and hobble on cheerfully
enough. In time this cheerfulness is increased by
the acquisition of two priceless pieces of knowledge;
one, that things are just as difficult for our neighbour
as ourself; the other, that by far the greatest
troubles in life are those which never arrive, but
expect to be met halfway.</p>

<p class="indent">It is the people who grow up early who do most
good in the world, for they find their feet soonest.
To others the day comes late,&mdash;usually in company
with some great grief or loss,&mdash;and these are
most to be pitied, for we all know that the older we
get the harder it becomes to adapt ourselves to new
conditions. Many a woman, for instance, passes
from twenty years of happy childhood straight into
twenty years of happy womanhood and motherhood
without speculating very deeply as to
whether she is happy or not. Then, perhaps, the
Reaper comes, and takes her husband, or a child,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
and she realises that she is grown up. Her life will
be a hard fight now. But, aided by the sweetness
and strength of Memory, accumulated throughout
the sunny years that lie behind, she too will win
through.</p>

<p class="indent">There are others, again, to whom the day of
growing-up never comes at all. They are the feeble
folk, perpetually asking Why, and never finding
out. Still, they always have to-morrow to look
forward to, in which they are more fortunate than
some.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Miss Marguerite Falconer was explaining
to the untutored Philip that it is possible
for grown-up people to suffer disappointment in
two departments of life,&mdash;the only two, she might
have added, that really matter at all,&mdash;Love and
Work.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How was your father disappointed, exactly?&quot;
asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He painted a big picture,&quot; said Peggy. &quot;He
was at it for years and years, though he was doing
a lot of other ones at the same time. He called the
other ones 'wolf-scarers,' because he said there was
a wolf outside on the Heath that wanted to get in
and eat us, and these pictures would frighten <i>any</i>
wolf away. I used to be afraid of meeting the wolf
on the Heath myself&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were quite small, then, of course,&quot; put in
Philip quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Falconer nodded, in acknowledgment of his
tact, and continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;but Nurse and Mother said there wasn't any
wolf really. It was a joke of Father's. He often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
makes jokes I don't understand. He is a funny
man. And he didn't use the pictures to frighten
the wolves with <i>really</i>: he sold them. But he never
sold the big picture. He went on working at it and
working at it for years and years. He began before
I was born, and he only finished it a few years ago,
so that just shows you how long he was. Whenever
he had sold a wolf-scarer he used to get back to the
big picture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What sort of picture was it?&quot; enquired Philip,
deeply interested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a very big picture,&quot; replied Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How big?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy considered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bigger than this gate we are sitting on,&quot; she
said at last. &quot;It was called 'The Many-Headed.'
Father sometimes called it 'Deemouse,' too,&mdash;or
something like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was it like?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy's eyes grew quite round with impressiveness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was the <i>strangest</i> thing,&quot; she said. &quot;It was a
great enormous giant, with heads, and heads, and
heads! You never saw such a lot of heads.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect that was why it was called 'The Many-Headed,'&quot;
observed Philip sapiently. &quot;What sort
of heads were they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They were most of them very ugly,&quot; continued
Peggy. &quot;They were twisting about everywhere,
and each one had its mouth wide open, shouting.
Dad kept on putting new ones in. There always
seemed to be room for one more. Like sticking
roses in a bowl, you know, only these heads weren't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
like roses. After a Bank Holiday he nearly always
had two or three fresh ones.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He used to go out then on the Heath&mdash;to
study the Canal, he said, and get fresh sketches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, who was inclined to be a little superior
on the subject of London geography, announced
firmly that there was no canal on Hampstead
Heath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only in Regent's Park,&quot; he said. &quot;Besides,
why should he sketch a canal?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was Peggy's turn to be superior.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Canal,&quot; she explained, &quot;is a French word, and
means people&mdash;people with concertinas and bananas,
who sing and wear each other's hats, and
leave paper about. Dad would sketch them when
they weren't looking, and then put them into the
picture. Oh, I forgot to tell you that the giant had
great huge hands, and he was clutching everything
he could lay his hands on&mdash;castles, and mountains,
and live people. He had a real king, with a
crown on, between his finger and thumb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about the disappointment?&quot; asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The disappointment? Oh, yes; I forgot. Well,
at last the picture was finished and sent away&mdash;in
a lovely frame. But it came back. One afternoon I
went into the studio, and there was Father. He
was sitting very quiet and still on a little stool in
front of the picture. He never moved, or looked
round, or said 'Go away!' when I came in. I was so
surprised. For a long time he had been having a
lot of bad tempers, so when I saw him sitting so
still and quiet I was quite frightened.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
&quot;I went and stood beside him, and looked at the
picture, too. Then he saw me, and said: 'It has
come back, you see, Peggy!' He said it two or
three times, I think. 'There are eight years of a
man's life in that picture&mdash;eight years of a man's
body and blood and bones! And it has been sent
back&mdash;sent back, by a parcel of promoted housepainters
who daren't let such a piece of work hang
on their walls because they know it would <i>kill</i> every
filthy daub of their own within reach!'</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then he asked me what we should do with it.
I said&mdash;of course I was <i>quite</i> small then&mdash;that I
thought if he took it and showed it to the wolf it
would frighten him away altogether. That made
him laugh. He laughed in a funny way, too, and
went on so long that I thought he would never
leave off. At last he stopped, and made a queer
noise in his throat, and said: 'No, we won't do
that. I will show you a more excellent way.' He
said that two or three times over, like he did before.
Then he got up, and went and pulled a big sword
and dagger out of a rack of armour and stuff in the
corner, and said: 'Now for some real fun, Peggy!'
and we cut up the picture into little bits. Father
slashed and slashed at it with the sword, and I
poked holes in it with the dagger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What fun!&quot; said Philip, the chord of destruction
thrilling within him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, wasn't it? I remember I cut the king
with the crown on right out of the picture, with the
giant's finger and thumb still round him. I kept it
for a long time, but I lost it at last. When we had
slashed the picture all to bits, Dad tore it out of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
frame and rolled it up into a bundle and threw it
into a corner. Then he went out for a long walk,
without his hat. When Mother came home she
cried. It was the only time I ever saw her cry. I
didn't know till then that grown-up people did. I
cried, too. I was little then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has your father painted any more pictures?&quot;
asked Philip, diverting the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;never. He only paints wolf-scarers now.
I tell him what to paint.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip's eyebrows rose, despite themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do!&quot; maintained Miss Falconer stoutly.
&quot;The other day he said to me: 'Here, Peggy, you
understand the taste of the Hoypolloy'&mdash;that's
another French word for people&mdash;'so give me an
idea for a pot-boiler.' (He calls wolf-scarers 'pot-boilers'
sometimes: I don't know why.) And I
said: 'Well, I think it would be nice to have a picture
of a little girl in a lovely frock with a new doll,
showing it round the doll's house and introducing
it to all the other dolls.' He laughed, and said:
'That's capital. I bet a sovereign they put that
one on the line.' When I asked what line, he said,
'the clothes line.' He is a funny man,&quot; concluded
Peggy once more.</p>

<p class="indent">They sat on for some time, discussing adult
peculiarities. Finally Philip announced that he
must go, for Uncle Joseph would return at four
o'clock and expect him to tea. As they parted,
Philip enquired awkwardly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Pegs,&mdash;will you tell me? I couldn't
help wondering about something just now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was it?&quot; enquired Peggy graciously.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
Philip asked his question too bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Peggy's small frame stiffened indignantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn't ever doing any such thing,&quot; she
announced in outraged tones.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, whose knowledge of the sex was improving,
had the sense to withdraw the imputation and
apologise at once. Then he waited.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps I was, just a little bit,&quot; admitted
Peggy presently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was the matter?&quot; asked Philip gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was Father. He boxed my ears after lunch,
for making a noise. I was only singing, but he is in
one of his bad tempers just now. He will be all
right in a day or two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, much to his surprise, found himself
trembling with indignation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does he do it often?&quot; he asked between his
clenched teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not often. Besides, he can't help it. Men
are just like children, Mother says. You have to
make allowances for them. I always try to remember
that. The daily work of half the women in the
world is to make allowances for some man or other,
Mother says. Good-night, Phil!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night, Pegs!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl ran off through the gathering gloom,
turning to wave her hand before she disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip walked slowly home, pondering in his
heart yet another (and quite unsuspected) aspect
of the relations between men and women.</p>

<p class="indent">There were two sides to every question, it
appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">His education was proceeding apace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<p class="h3">MISTAKEN IDENTITY</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Uncle Joseph</span> had an adventure in town which
amused him immensely.</p>

<p class="indent">The International Brotherhood of Kind Young
Hearts, it may be remembered, radiated its appeals
from within the precincts of Pontifex Mansions,
Shaftesbury Avenue. It was quite a good address,
but, like many of the good things of this world,
looked best on paper.</p>

<p class="indent">The Kind Young Hearts rented a small office-flat
at the top of a block of rather out-of-date
buildings in the neighbourhood of Dean Street.
The flat was uninhabited, and contained not a
particle of furniture of any description except a
capacious letter-box; but these deficiencies, which
might have roused unworthy suspicions in the
breasts of some of the more worldly of Uncle
Joseph's supporters, were covered by the fact that
the door was double-locked, and no subscriber had
ever entered the premises. On the door itself the
name of the Society was painted in neat black
letters. Underneath was pinned a typewritten
notice,&mdash;of an apparently temporary character,
but in reality as enduring as Uncle Joseph's tenancy,&mdash;to
the effect that the Secretary had been
called away to the country on an urgent case, but
hoped to return shortly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
It was Uncle Joseph's custom to make a periodical
inspection of this establishment, though he left
to James Nimmo the task of making the weekly
collection of letters. On this occasion all seemed in
order. No restive subscriber waited on the landing;
no emissary of the law, masquerading as a stargazer,
lounged in the street outside. No one had
tampered with the Chubb lock on the door. No
one had scribbled opprobrious comments across
the Secretary's notice. All was peace.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph entered the flat. The box contained
half a dozen letters, which he opened and
read in the dusty sunlight of the office.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Mr. Charles Turner, junior member
of the editorial staff of the &quot;Searchlight,&quot; was
mounting the staircase with all the headlong eagerness
of a young and inexperienced fox-terrier in
pursuit of his first rat. He took himself seriously,
did Turner, which was a pity; for a touch of humour
is indispensable to a man whose profession it
is to expose humbugs. Dill, his chief, possessed this
quality in perfection, with a strong dash of cynicism
thrown in. He knew that righteous wrath was
wasted upon the tribe of quacks and sharpers. He
never invoked the assistance of the law against
such gentry. He preferred the infinitely more
amusing plan of exposing their methods in cold
print and leaving it to them to invoke the assistance
of the law against <i>him</i>. Consequently
his name was a hissing and an abomination
among all the fraternity, while the British Public,
though strongly suspicious of Dill's sense of humour,
took in, read, and profited by the &quot;Searchlight&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
in general and its Rogues' Catalogue in
particular.</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;Searchlight&quot; was unique. There were
other organs which made a speciality of exposing
quackery, but these could seldom resist the temptation
of endeavouring&mdash;usually successfully&mdash;to
blackmail the quack as an alternative to exposing
him. But the &quot;Searchlight&quot; was above suspicion.
It had never attempted to run with the
hare and hunt with the hounds, for the excellent
reason that such a proceeding would have bored
its proprietor. Dill harried the unjust, not from
any special feeling of tenderness towards the just,
but in order to gratify his own rather impish sense
of humour. He had no special regard for the feelings
or pocket of the British Public, but he loved
to clap an impostor in the pillory and watch him
squirm.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the seventh visit of the zealous Turner
to the headquarters of the Kind Young Hearts.
He had missed James Nimmo on the previous
Thursday, for that astute emissary always made
his call for the letters about eight o'clock in the
morning: so Turner was still without evidence as to
whether the flat was in use at all. His gratification,
then, on beholding the door standing open was
extreme.</p>

<p class="indent">He peeped inside. Standing by the window of
the bare and dusty room he beheld a middle-aged,
military-looking gentleman perusing letters. The
enemy was delivered into his hands. He tapped at
the door and walked in.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph looked up from the last letter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
gave Mr. Turner a polite good-morning. The
sleuth-hound replied in suitable terms, and embarked
upon a tactful yet deadly cross-examination,
long laid up in readiness for such an opportunity
as this.</p>

<p class="indent">But he was faced with a difficulty at the outset.
Anxious not to alarm his quarry, he had decided to
open the attack with a few pleasant observations
upon the convenient situation of the office and the
tasteful character of its furniture and appointments.
So, hastily reining back his opening sentence,
which began: &quot;This is a snug little establishment
of yours, sir. I expect you get through a lot
of solid business here,&quot;&mdash;which sprang automatically
to his lips,&mdash;Mr. Turner remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have called in reference to a circular which
you sent me a few days ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did I?&quot; replied Uncle Joseph blandly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. It was an appeal for funds for the International
Brotherhood of Kind Young Hearts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is most interesting,&quot; said Uncle Joseph,
putting his letters back into their envelopes. &quot;But
tell me, how do you know that it was I who sent
you a circular; and why have you tracked me to
an empty flat in Soho to talk to me about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren't these the offices of the Brotherhood of
Kind Young Hearts?&quot; asked Turner, a little
abashed.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph smiled indulgently, and looked
round him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They don't <i>look</i> very like the offices of a charitable
organization,&quot; he said&mdash;&quot;do they? Charity
begins in a <i>home</i>, you know. That being the case, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
rather fancy your Kind-Hearted friends would at
least have furnished themselves with something to
sit down on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Turner, although he was young and inexperienced,
was no fool. Otherwise he would not
have been upon the staff of the &quot;Searchlight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Charitable organizations sometimes employ
accommodation addresses,&quot; he said, regarding
Uncle Joseph keenly; &quot;especially when they are
not quite&mdash;you see?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered, &quot;I see. Well, Mr.&mdash;I
don't think I caught your name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Turner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. Well, Mr. Turner, accommodation
address or not, I am afraid your birds are flown.
You will have to seek them in some other eyrie.
You see, I have been in possession of this flat for
some few days now. In fact, several letters have
already been addressed to me here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He held out the little bundle of envelopes, in
such a way that Mr. Turner found it quite impossible
to read the addresses, and then put them back
into his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must have the name on that door painted
out,&quot; continued Uncle Joseph briskly, &quot;or I may
have more investigators descending upon me. Not
that I am anything but delighted to make your
acquaintance, Mr.&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you quite sure,&quot; said Turner steadily,
&quot;that you are not the Secretary of the organization
whose name is painted on that door?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph laughed easily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
&quot;Under this impressive cross-examination,&quot; he
said, &quot;I know I shall presently feel quite certain
that I am! Mr. Turner, you fill me with guilty
apprehensions. It is a great gift of yours. May I
ask if you are a representative of the law? Or are
you the emissary of some newspaper? Or are you
merely taking up detection as a hobby?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Turner flushed. He felt certain that he was being
bluffed, but Uncle Joseph would give him no opening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I represent the 'Searchlight,'&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case,&quot; said Uncle Joseph cheerfully, &quot;I
shall be delighted to offer you a lift back to the
office. I am going to call on Mr. Dill at twelve
o'clock. Come downstairs, and let us see if we can
get a cab anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He locked the door of the flat, and proceeded
cheerfully down the staircase, followed by the
dazed and defeated Mr. Turner.</p>

<p class="indent">Ten minutes later Uncle Joseph was shaking
hands with Dill.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have just had a narrow escape of being haled
to justice by one of your bright young men,&quot; he
said; and recounted his adventure.</p>

<p class="indent">Dill, lying back in his chair and smoking a
cigarette,&mdash;it was said that he got through a box
a day,&mdash;heard the story and chuckled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An unlucky coincidence for Turner,&quot; he said.
&quot;Still, he is all right. He is young, and wants a bit
more savvy, but he is a glutton for work and as
plucky as they make them. I always send him
where I think there is a likelihood of any chucking-out
being attempted. I am quite at sea about this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
Kind Heart business. It is evidently a biggish
affair, with a big man behind it. I can't make out
whether he is an old friend, or a new candidate for
the Rogues' Catalogue altogether. But I'll nab
him yet. Have another cigarette?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are your Christmas charities going?&quot;
enquired Uncle Joseph, helping himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not too well,&quot; said Dill. &quot;In the old days
things were simple enough. I asked for the money
and I got it. Now the public are bled white either
by knaves like this fellow who runs the Kind
Hearts, or a parcel of incompetent sentimental
old women who waste one half of what they get on
expenses and the other half on pauperisation. I
have had a deficit each year for three years now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph took out a pocket-book, and
counted out twenty five-pound notes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can run to a little more this year,&quot; he said.
&quot;Here you are&mdash;fifty for the free dinners and
fifty for the toy-distribution. Anonymous, of
course, as usual.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dill gathered up the money.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meldrum,&quot; he said,&mdash;and his voice sounded
less like a raven's than usual,&mdash;&quot;you are a white
man. I say no more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-morning,&quot; said Uncle Joseph.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<p class="h3">RENOVARE DOLOREM</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> leaven was working.</p>

<p class="indent">One evening after tea Philip took a big breath
and addressed his uncle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Uncle Joseph,&quot; he said, &quot;I was talking to a
little girl on Hampstead Heath to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;More fool you,&quot; was the genial response.
&quot;What were you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You,&quot; said Philip, a little unexpectedly.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph looked up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; he said. &quot;Why was I so honoured?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip explained, in his deliberate fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was that little girl we passed on Sunday,&quot;
he said, &quot;sitting on a gate. She smiled at me, and
you told me it was only an instinct. A prebby&mdash;a
prebby&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph assisted him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;predatory instinct. Well, I met her again
one day, and I told her what you said. I explained
that you knew all women were dangerous, and
were the great stumbling-block to a man's work in
life. Also parasites.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph smiled grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, and what did she say to that?&quot; he
enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She said she would ask her mother about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph nodded.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
&quot;They always do,&quot; he commented. &quot;And what
did Mother say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her mother said&mdash;&quot; Philip hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on,&quot; said Uncle Joseph quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She said that&mdash;that the reason why you
thought that all women should be avoided was
known only to one woman, and she wouldn't tell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Colonel Meldrum rose to his feet, and laid his
pipe upon the mantelpiece with a slight clatter.
Philip eyed him curiously. There was a change in
his appearance. He seemed to have grown older
during the last ten seconds. The lines of his face
were sharper, and his stiff shoulders drooped a
little.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came a long and deathlike stillness. Uncle
Joseph had turned his back, and was gazing into
the glowing fire, with his head resting on his arms.
Philip, feeling a little frightened, waited.</p>

<p class="indent">At last Uncle Joseph spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How old are you, boy?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fourteen,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">There was another silence. Then Uncle Joseph
spoke again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You should be old enough to understand now.
Your friend's mother was right, Phil. Would you
like to hear the story?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, please,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph turned round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; he asked curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip replied with characteristic frankness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because,&quot; he said, &quot;it might make it easier for
me to keep away from all women, like what you
told me to do, if I knew the reason why I ought to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
&quot;You are beginning to find it difficult, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, thinking of a blue cotton frock and a pair
of brown eyes, nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I will try and make it easier for you,&quot;
said Uncle Joseph. &quot;It is my plain duty to do so,
for if once you get into your head the notion that
woman is man's better half and guiding angel, or
any sentimental, insidious nonsense of that kind,
you are doomed. Your father allowed himself to
cherish such beliefs, and he died of a broken heart
before he was thirty. You are your father's son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who broke his heart?&quot; asked Philip, looking
up quickly. It was the first time that Uncle Joseph
had ever mentioned his father to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your mother,&quot; said Uncle Joseph bluntly.
&quot;She broke another man's heart later on, but that
is another story. Perhaps the other man deserved
it, but your father, above all men, did not. Have
we read Tennyson together?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip. &quot;'The Idylls of the King.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You remember King Arthur?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip nodded, beginning dimly to comprehend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, your mother was Guinevere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip was silent for a while. Then he asked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that why you say we must avoid all women?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Partly. There was my own case as well. When
I was well over thirty, Philip, I fell in love. I had
never loved any woman before, because my whole
life and soul were bound up in the regiment. I fell
in love with the regiment when I joined it as a little
subaltern, and I worshipped it for sixteen years.
In course of time they made me adjutant, which
cures most men of such predilections, but it only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
made me feel as proud as a hen with eight hundred
chickens. Then, just as I got my final step and
became commanding officer, I met a girl and fell in
love with her. It was in Calcutta. She was the
spoiled beauty of that season, and I was the youngest
colonel in the Indian Army, so everybody
thought it a very suitable match.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We did not get engaged for quite a long time,
though. Oh, no! First of all, I had to learn to
dance attendance. As I say, I had never been in
love before, or even had any great experience of
women. All my time had been lavished on the
regiment. So I laboured under the delusion that if
a man loved a woman, his proper course was to tell
her so straight, and prove his words by devoting
himself to her service. I have learned wisdom since
then, but that was what I thought at the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What ought you to have done, Uncle Joseph?&quot;
asked Philip curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ought either to have bullied her, or gone and
made love to another girl. Those are the only two
arguments which a woman appreciates. But I
made myself too cheap. This girl, as soon as she
found that she was quite sure of me, began to play
with me. She ordered me about in public, and I
loved her so much that I obeyed her, and did not
regard her behaviour as the least underbred or
vulgar. She gave me rather degrading odd jobs to
do, and I did them, proud to think that I was her
squire. As for presents, if I gave her something
that she did not chance to want or possessed already,
it was declined with every manifestation of
offended propriety, but if she did happen to require
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
anything, she told me to get it for her, and I did so
gladly, for I felt that all these little trifles were
gradually binding us together. I had not quite
grasped a woman's idea of playing the game in
those days, you see. I thought all this aloofness
of hers was due to a young girl's reserve of character,
and that, being too shy and timid to tell me in
so many words that she cared for me, she was
accepting all my devotion and my little offerings
purposely and deliberately, in order to show me
that, although she could not bring herself to say
the word at present, she meant to do the square
thing in the end. I loved her for <i>that</i>, and tried to
be patient. But once, when I, presuming on this
theory of mine, suggested to her that she must care
for me rather more than she gave me to understand,
she flashed out at me and told me that I
ought to be proud to serve her free gratis and for
nothing, and that a <i>true</i> knight never hoped for any
reward from his lady otherwise than an occasional
smile and word of thanks. On the whole, I think
that was the most outrageous statement I have
ever heard fall from the lips of a human being; but
as uttered by her it actually sounded rather splendid!
It made me feel quite ashamed of myself,
Philip. I said I was a mercenary brute, and asked
her to forgive me. This, after I had made an abject
exhibition of myself, she ultimately did.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the next few months I had a pretty bad
time of it. I loved her too much to keep away from
her, but my self-respect was at zero. I had to put
my pride in my pocket and undergo some humiliation
nearly every day. To stand about for hours,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
waiting for a dance, perhaps to have it cut in the
end; to dash off parade and change out of uniform
and gallop away to a riding appointment, perhaps
to find that she had forgotten all about it; to be
compelled to laugh and look amused when she said
uncharitable things about my best friends&mdash;that
was my daily round, Philip. Yes, they were stiff
days, and I saw they would get worse. When you
find yourself gradually ceasing to respect a woman
without ceasing to love her, then you are in for a
demoralizing time, my son.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I endured it all. I summoned up fresh
stocks of patience and philosophy. I told myself
that she was only a child, and a spoiled child at
that; and that she would shake down presently.
When she was a little older and wiser, she would
realise what humiliation she had often heaped upon
me, and she would come and say she was sorry, in
her pretty way, and ask me to forgive her; and I
would do so, and we would live happily ever afterwards.
Meanwhile I must be enormously patient.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then suddenly, without any sort of warning,
just as I was reaching the limit of physical endurance,&mdash;there
is a physical side to these things,
Philip, as you may find some day,&mdash;she capitulated,
and we became engaged. For a fortnight I
lived in the clouds. I gave her all the presents I
could think of, and then sat down and unfolded to
her all my dreams and visions for the future. I told
her how proud the regiment would be of her, and
what a splendid regiment we would make of it
between us. I confessed to her, just like a penitent
child, that I had been neglecting the regiment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
late, all on her account. Now that the suspense
and worry was over I meant to work double tides
and make the old regiment twice as efficient as it
had ever been. I told her I felt like a giant refreshed.
With her beside me, there was no limit to
things we might do with that regiment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then Vivien&mdash;that was her name&mdash;interrupted
me. She said, in her pretty imperious
way:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'Joe dear, your regiment bores me. You never
talk of anything else. In future I forbid you to
mention it in my presence.' Then she kissed me,
and took me off to a tea-fight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph, who had been striding about the
room during this narration, suddenly halted and
faced his nephew.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Looking back now,&quot; he said, &quot;it is plain to me
that this was the point at which I ought to have
made a stand. I should have taken Vivi firmly,
and said to her: 'My dearest child,'&mdash;Uncle
Joseph's voice dropped to a gentle, caressing murmur,
but he recovered himself with a jerk,&mdash;'understand
this. A man's work is his life. It is his
father and his mother, and his meat and his drink,
and the air he breathes; and the woman who marries
him must be prepared to stand by his side and
see him through it, and not to hang round his neck
and get between him and what he has to do. She
must sympathise with him when things go wrong,
and share his satisfaction when they come right
again. If she grows jealous of his work and tries to
detach him from it, there will be a disaster. Therefore
you must take me and my work together or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
forswear us both, for they cannot be divided.'
That is what I should have said, Philip, for I knew
it was true, even as she kissed me. But I didn't.
I thought I should be able to educate her up to
appreciation of my beloved regiment, and that her
prejudice and selfishness would weaken in time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I was wrong. It was I who weakened. I
began by turning out less frequently at parade. I
began to cut mess. I began to lose touch with the
rank and file. Formerly it had been my pride to
know the name of every man in my regiment, and
something about him. Soon I found myself saluted
by men on the parade-ground whose faces I did not
recognise. Then I began to listen to Vivien's criticisms
of my officers. She sneered at my subalterns,
because some of them were hard up and could not
keep polo ponies. She called them 'a fusty lot,'&mdash;half
of them had seen active service before they
were twenty-one,&mdash;and compared them unfavourably
with the Viceroy's Staff. She appeared to
regard my affection for them as a sort of slight to
herself. She looked down on my splendid little
Gurkhas, and said it was a pity I could not get
command of a white regiment. And I, instead of
telling her straight that she must never speak in
that way of my men again, began by making a few
lame excuses for them and ended by acquiescing
in her opinions. I found myself patronising my
own officers&mdash;some of the finest soldiers in the
Service&mdash;and drifting into an attitude of superciliousness
towards soldiering in general. And all
this, Philip, arose from that ennobling passion,
Love!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
&quot;Then, when the hot weather came, she went
away to Simla. I was to follow her in a month.
During that month I came to myself again. I
realised, once and for all, that a man's duty comes
first in this world, and straightway I saw life
clearly and as a whole once more. The cloud that
had settled over the regiment lifted again, and by
the time I went on leave we were as happy a band
as ever.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I travelled up to the hills full of tremendous
emotions, Philip. In the first place, I had not seen
Vivien for over a month, and I was mad with the
desire of setting eyes on her again. In the second
place, I was determined to make it plain that she
must not attempt to come between me and the
regiment again. It was a delicate problem to
tackle, I knew; but I still hugged the delusion that
she was only a child and could be educated up to a
wife's duties. But I saw a big fight ahead of me&mdash;a
big fight!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph's voice dropped, and the light of
battle died out of his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was the end of the fight?&quot; asked Philip,
apprehensively. He saw tragedy on the horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph laughed. It was not a pleasant
sound.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I need not have worried,&quot; he said. &quot;There was
no fight. When I got to Simla I discovered that she
had been engaged to another man for nearly a
fortnight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip shrank back into his chair, stunned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She had not even written to tell me,&quot; continued
Uncle Joseph. &quot;She had allowed me to travel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
half across India to see her, and then&mdash;!... People
told me he wasn't a bad fellow. A bit of a boor,
but a good sort on the whole. He was heir to a title
of some kind, I think. I never saw him&mdash;or her,
after the one interview.... They were married
about a month later.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I went back to the regiment. I had that consolation,
I told myself. Nothing stood between me
and my work now. But I was wrong again. Nothing
seemed worth while any more. Regimental
routine wearied me to death, and presently I understood
what had happened. In the old days I had
loved the regiment because it was <i>my</i> regiment:
latterly I had loved it because it was <i>her</i> regiment,
and I wanted to make it a credit to her. Now
that she was gone&mdash;<i>cui bono</i>? But I fought on&mdash;I
would not give in. I was mechanical, but pretty
thorough. I fulfilled every duty rigidly. The only
difference was that, whereas the regiment had formerly
been commanded by a Damascus blade, it
was now commanded by a broomstick, and it went
about its work correspondingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, three months later, came a letter from
your father. He was dying, Phil,&mdash;dying of a
broken heart, if ever a man did. His story was the
same as mine, only more shameful. He asked me to
take charge of you. Then I saw light: my duty lay
plain ahead of me. I would go home and devote
the rest of my life to protecting my nephew from
the monstrous danger of Woman. I sent in my
papers, came home, and took charge of you; and
here we are! I have spoken.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph dropped unconcernedly back into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
his armchair, and relit the ashes of his pipe. But
his fingers were shaking.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip sat still and silent for a long time. Then
he asked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was she very pretty, Uncle Joseph?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was the most beautiful creature I have ever
seen,&quot; said Uncle Joseph simply.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip ventured on one more question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she alive now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said. &quot;I have dropped so
thoroughly out of the world that the social history
of the past ten years is a blank to me. I never have
heard of her since I left India. I do not even know
her husband's title.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph turned to his nephew. A grim
smile played about the ends of his mustache.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, laddie,&quot; he enquired, &quot;have I made
things any easier for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip flushed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he muttered. But he
knew only too well.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean this,&quot; said Uncle Joseph. &quot;Has my
story made it any easier for you to relinquish your
acquaintance with the small siren of Hampstead
Heath?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was the first critical moment in Philip's life.
Reason and Instinct&mdash;the truculent logic of his
uncle and the gentle, chivalrous spirit of his father&mdash;fought
for mastery within him. Instinct won,
and he replied doggedly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So am I,&quot; said Uncle Joseph, rising to his feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
again. &quot;However, you must be protected from
yourself. Listen! You will drop your acquaintance
with this little girl, and refrain from making any
other friendships of a similar nature so long as you
remain in my charge. It is an order. You understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip bowed his head in silence. He had been
brought up in a soldier's house, and when Uncle
Joseph spoke in his orderly-room voice there was
nothing more to be said on the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">That night, for the first time in his life, Philip
cried himself to sleep. He had pledged his knightly
word to keep tryst with a lady on Hampstead
Heath the following afternoon, and now he would
have to break it.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE INCONSISTENCY OF UNCLE JOSEPH</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">But</span> no. Nothing of the kind.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a most amazing day altogether.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a Thursday. They paid the usual visit to
the bank, after which Philip and his uncle parted
company at Swiss Cottage Station, and Philip
walked resolutely home. The Elysian Fields were
closed to him. He wondered how long Peggy would
wait, and what she would think when he did not
come. He hoped that in her quaint, old-fashioned
way she would take a leaf from her mother's book
and &quot;make allowances&quot; for him.</p>

<p class="indent">Holly Lodge was deserted, for James Nimmo had
washed up and gone round the corner, in accordance
with his invariable custom of an afternoon, in
order to recuperate exhausted nature by partaking
of what he termed &quot;a wee hauf.&quot; (Philip often
wondered what he did with the other half.) Philip
let himself in at the side door with his latchkey,
and, sitting down before the library fire, endeavoured
to divert his thoughts by reading &quot;The
Idylls of the King.&quot; He turned up &quot;Merlin and
Vivien,&quot; which he had not previously studied, and
set to work upon it. He had a personal interest in
the name of Vivien now.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, two people were converging upon
Holly Lodge.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
The first was Uncle Joseph, returning from the
City an hour and a half before his time. His business
had been cut short by the sudden illness of
one of his almoners, and he found himself free to
return home at half-past three. He sat in a comparatively
empty District Railway carriage&mdash;the
human tide was not due to ebb for nearly two
hours yet&mdash;perusing the current number of the
&quot;Searchlight.&quot; It contained two interesting paragraphs.</p>

<p class="indent">The first said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>For some time past readers of the</i> &quot;Searchlight&quot; <i>have
been forwarding to me copies of a weekly appeal for cash
issued by an enterprising organisation calling itself &quot;The
International Brotherhood of Kind Young Hearts.&quot; The
modus operandi of the ingenious gentleman who conducts
this precious enterprise is not without its merits. Evidently
with the idea of appealing to every possible shade of sentimentality,
the circular is furnished with a list of no less
than fifteen charitable objects, and the dupes of the Brotherhood
are requested to select the case, or cases, which excite
their compassion most, and mark these upon the list when
forwarding their donations. The objects for which contributions
are invited are most artistically varied, ranging as
they do from the maintenance of &quot;A Home for Unwanted
Doggies&quot; to the rehabilitation of a repentant but slightly
indefinite burglar; but I can assure prospective contributors,
with the utmost confidence, that, however meticulously they
may earmark their pet cases, their money will all find its
way into one capacious pocket. The administration of this
exceptionally ingenious scheme of flat-catching is evidently
in capable and experienced hands. Last week, anxious to
make the acquaintance of the master-mind, I despatched
one of my trustiest representatives to the headquarters of</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
<i>the Brotherhood, hoping that Big Brother&mdash;or whatever the
arch flat-catcher calls himself&mdash;might be found at home.
The offices are situated in Pontifex Mansions, Shaftesbury
Avenue, and consist of an undistinguished suite of apartments
with the name of the Brotherhood painted upon the
outer door, accompanied by a typewritten notice to the effect
that the Secretary has gone to the country&mdash;a piece of
information which is not altogether surprising. Here the
scent abruptly ended, for enquiries elicited the news that the
tenancy of the Brotherhood had terminated. Indeed, a new
tenant was actually in possession when my representative
called. We may, therefore, confidently expect Big Brother
to break out shortly in a fresh place, probably with the
name of his organisation slightly altered. As an alternative
to &quot;Kind Young Hearts,&quot; may I respectfully suggest &quot;Fine
Old Sharks&quot;?</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">In another part of the paper Dill delivered his
weekly comments upon the progress of his Christmas
funds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>Subscriptions for the Christmas Dinner and Toy Funds
are coming in steadily, and I am beginning to entertain
high hopes of closing this year's account without a deficit.
I have again to thank numerous old friends, whose names
will be found in the list below, for the faithfulness and regularity
with which they come to my assistance. This week's
list is headed by an anonymous contribution of a hundred
pounds. The giver is a gentleman whom, though his name
is known to few, I regard as one of the most generous, and
perhaps the most practical, philanthropist of my acquaintance.
I have never known him to subscribe to an undeserving
cause, and I have never known him refuse a worthy
appeal. His gifts are made upon the sole condition that his
name is not published. I am not prone to gush, and I will
therefore refrain from commenting upon this rather unusual</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
<i>persistence in doing good by stealth. But I believe
that deeds of this kind do not go unrewarded, and I can
assure my anonymous friend that if he sets any store by the
blessings of tired mothers and hungry children, they are his
in abundance.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph smiled a wry smile, and turned to
the financial article.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The second was a lady. She rang the bell at
Holly Lodge just as Philip reached the last page of
&quot;Merlin and Vivien.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">James Nimmo was still moistening earth's clay
at the establishment round the corner, and Philip
answered the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Before him, standing on the doorstep, he beheld
a tall, beautiful, and gracious lady. She was
dressed in deep black, and looked old&mdash;quite
thirty-five; possibly forty. She had a rather sad
face, Philip thought, but it lit up wonderfully
when she smiled, which she did as soon as she
beheld the stolid, sturdy little figure in the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this Holly Lodge, little boy?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye&mdash;es,&quot; stammered Philip. Evidently his
visitor purposed crossing the threshold, and rules
upon that subject were inflexible.</p>

<p class="indent">The Beautiful Lady smiled again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I know who you are,&quot; she said. &quot;You
are called Tommy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted Philip apprehensively. &quot;Only
sometimes,&quot; he hastened to add.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect you have a grander name for state
occasions,&quot; said the Beautiful Lady.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
Philip might have mentioned that he possessed
several, but he had the good sense merely to nod his
head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are your parents at home?&quot; continued the
visitor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid there is nobody at home but me,&quot;
replied Philip, nerving himself to shut the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is capital,&quot; said the Beautiful Lady.
&quot;It is you whom I want to talk to particularly. So
I am going to ask you to entertain me until your
father and mother come home. Will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Unconscious of the length of the visit to which
she had committed herself, the lady walked into
the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip swiftly reviewed the essential features of
the situation. The most obvious and pressing was
the fact that a female had gained admittance to
Holly Lodge. The second followed as a corollary&mdash;she
must be ejected before Uncle Joseph returned.
That would not be for a couple of hours at least.
Surely he could get rid of her by that time. He led
the intruder into the library&mdash;there was no
drawing-room at Holly Lodge&mdash;and begged her
to be seated. Then he installed himself upon the
edge of a chair on the other side of the fireplace
and took feverish counsel within himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must be wondering who I am,&quot; said the
Beautiful Lady pleasantly. &quot;I ought to have introduced
myself sooner. My name is Lady Broadhurst,
and I live in Hampshire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip remembered addressing the envelope now.
He nodded politely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know,&quot; he said. &quot;Plumbley Royal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
&quot;That is right,&quot; said Lady Broadhurst. &quot;I have
been puzzling as to why you should have thought
of writing to <i>me</i>. Where did you come across my
address, I wonder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was in an old Red Book,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see. Still, it is strange that you should have
selected me,&quot; continued the Beautiful Lady musingly.
She seemed perplexed, yet gratified, evidently
suspecting the hand of Providence. Philip
might have explained that the wonder would have
lain less in his visitor's selection than in her omission,&mdash;he
had sent a copy of Tommy Smith's letter
to every widow in the book whose name began with
B,&mdash;but his mind was working frantically behind
a solemn countenance, and he did not answer. He
was trying to put himself in Uncle Joseph's place.
How would he have treated this intrusion? How
would he have parried questions about Tommy
Smith? How would he have substantiated the
starving curate and his fireless home, in the face of
the solid comfort of Holly Lodge and the absolute
invisibility of the curate and his emaciated progeny?
Would he have dressed up James Nimmo
as a curate? Would he have sent out to Finchley
Road for a lady to represent the curate's tearful
consort? Would he have explained that the curate
had just received preferment and gone to live at
Berwick-on-Tweed? Possibly; but such feats of
imposture were beyond the powers of a slow-witted,
inherently honest philogynist of fourteen.</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Broadhurst was speaking again, in a low,
musical voice, holding out her hands to the blazing
fire. Philip noticed that these hands were long and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
thin, like Peggy's and unlike the hands of the
women whom he sometimes encountered sitting in
omnibuses or serving in shops. Her feet were tiny,
too. In the glow of the fire her eyelashes looked
long and wet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was very much touched,&quot; she was saying,
&quot;by your letter. Your wanting a little girl for a
sister came very near home to me; for I have just
lost a little girl of my own. She was all I had,
Tommy. She was taken from me three months ago....
I suppose we should take our losses as they
come, without wincing or questioning the wisdom
of God. But I was weak&mdash;and selfish. For a
long time I refused to bow to his will. I cried out,
and would not be comforted....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Beautiful Lady's eyes were really glistening
now. Presently a tear splashed on to the long white
hand. Philip felt strangely uncomfortable. He had
been warned by his uncle more than once to beware,
above all, of a woman's tears. &quot;Her tears are the
biggest gun in her battery,&quot; Uncle Joseph had
said. But Philip forgot to feel suspicious. He was
only intensely sorry for the lady.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently she began to speak again, not altogether
to Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I came to myself,&quot; she said. &quot;I suddenly
learned that all things work together for good&mdash;that
there is no sorrow which does not bring its
own consolation with it. One day I saw myself as I
was&mdash;a querulous, self-centered, self-conscious,
self-made martyr. I had forgotten that other
people had their troubles too&mdash;troubles which I
might do something to smooth away.&quot; She looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
up. &quot;Do you know who taught me that lesson,
Tommy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip shook his head apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid I don't,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me?&quot; said Philip, a little dazed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;you! It was your letter. When I read it
I learned, all of a sudden, where the cure for sorrow
lies. It lies in trying to help others. So I have come
to see you and your parents, in the hope that I
may be allowed to be of some small service to you
all. I cannot give you a little sister to play with&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lady's voice broke suddenly, and Philip
tactfully arose and put coal upon the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;but I may be able to help you in other ways.
I am fairly well off, and I ask to be permitted to see
that your father gets back to health and strength
again. Do you think he would consent? He might
like to go abroad for a little.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip began to feel horribly uncomfortable. He
had already allowed his visitor to assume that she
was in the dwelling of an indigent Clerk in Holy
Orders, and that she was addressing Master
Thomas Smith. Moreover, he had sat mute while
she laid bare to him the tenderest secrets of a
woman's heart, and the thought of what the end of
the conversation must be made him feel a pitiful
little cad. On the other hand, it was plainly advisable
to establish some sort of working explanation,
however lame, of the non-appearance of the Smith
family. Once more, what would Uncle Joseph have
done? He would probably have explained to this
gracious being quite courteously but extremely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
firmly, that she was an incubus and a parasite,
actuated by predatory instincts, and would have
cast her from the house. But Philip felt utterly
incapable of and entirely disinclined to such a
drastic course of action. But plainly, something
must be done. His head began to swim.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps your father and mother would like to
go away together for a few weeks,&quot; suggested the
Beautiful Lady. A glow of cheerful kindness was
creeping into her cheeks. &quot;To the seaside, perhaps,
or even to the south of France. They could take
the baby with them, and you might come to me,
Tommy. Could you accept me as your mother for
a week or two, do you think?&quot; There was a world
of wistfulness in her voice. &quot;Could you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Apparently not, for straightway the solemn-faced
little boy before her flushed scarlet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I'm afraid you have been making a mistake,&quot;
began Philip desperately. &quot;I'm not Tommy
Smith at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Broadhurst looked puzzled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not Tommy Smith? But you wrote me that
letter, surely?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I wrote it,&quot; admitted Philip in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then where is the mistake? You are not the
baby, are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I'm not the baby either,&quot; said Philip
miserably.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But your father&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven't got any father&mdash;or mother, I'm
afraid,&quot; said Philip, feeling more guilty than ever.</p>

<p class="indent">The lady paused, and contemplated him with
quickened interest.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
&quot;You poor little lad!&quot; she said, very softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But whose house is this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My uncle's.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Broadhurst's face cleared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; she said. &quot;You have no parents of your
own, but live with your uncle and aunt. Naturally
you would regard them as your father and mother,
and speak of them as such. I understand now. But
that shall make no difference. In fact I like the
scrupulous way you tell me everything. If your
uncle is ill&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He isn't ill,&quot; said Philip regretfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then he is better?&quot; said Lady Broadhurst with
a cheerful smile. &quot;In that case he will be able to
travel at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip gripped the arm of his chair. The bad
time had come.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My uncle isn't a&mdash;&quot; he began.</p>

<p class="indent">He was going to say &quot;curate,&quot; but at that moment,
to his profound surprise and unspeakable
relief, there fell upon his ears the music of a latchkey
in a lock, followed by the banging of the front
door. Uncle Joseph had returned, an hour and a
half before his time.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, whatever happened now, the responsibility
had slipped from Philip's shoulders. And in the
midst of all the present turmoil of his senses one
emotion overtopped all the others&mdash;a feeling of
intense curiosity to behold the arch-expert in
misogyny handling the situation.</p>

<p class="indent">It would be a sensational scene, Philip thought.
And he was not disappointed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, there, Philip!&quot; Uncle Joseph's voice rang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
out from the hall. &quot;Are you in?&quot; The library door
stood ajar, and his words could be heard distinctly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Uncle Joseph!&quot; called Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is my uncle,&quot; he explained, turning
politely to the Beautiful Lady. &quot;He&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the words died on his lips. Lady Broadhurst
was on her feet, deadly white, and shaking. One
hand was at her heart, the other fumbled at the
mantelpiece for support.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph's voice rang out again, this time
from the neighbourhood of the hatstand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm back sooner than I expected. Skip about
and get me some tea, you young beggar!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Beautiful Lady's white lips parted, and she
uttered a faint cry. But she did not move.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip went out into the hall. His uncle was
hanging up his greatcoat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, young man?&quot; he observed cheerfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is some one wanting to see you in the
library, Uncle Joseph,&quot; said Philip falteringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A&mdash;a lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph's brow darkened instantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>A lady?</i>&quot; he said icily. &quot;Who let her in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did. At least, she came in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we can appraise responsibility later.
Meanwhile&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph, very stiff and erect, strode across
the hall and into the library.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">There was a moment of dead silence, and then a
great cry; then a rush of feet; then silence again&mdash;silence
that could be felt.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
What had happened? Philip wondered.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, at last, came voices.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Vivien! Vivien! Vivien! My little Vivien,
after all these years! Thank God for his infinite
goodness and mercy! My Vivien! My little girl!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joe! Joe! Dear, dear Joe! At last, at last!
Hold me closer, dear! I can't believe it yet! I'm
frightened&mdash;hold me closer! Oh, my dear, my
dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the voices blended into an indeterminate,
cooing, soothing murmur.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip looked into the library.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon the hearthrug, with his back to the door,
stood Uncle Joseph, misogynist. In his arms he
held the Beautiful Lady, and he was passionately
kissing her eyes, her hair, her lips.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Philip retired in good order and closed the door
softly, leaving them together.</p>

<p class="indent">Once in the hall, he snatched up his cap and coat
and slipped out of the front door. The afternoon
light was fading.</p>

<p class="indent">There was still a chance, he thought.</p>

<p class="indent">He broke into a run.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE HAMPSTEAD HEATH CONSPIRACY</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">He</span> was right, but it was touch and go. Peggy
was climbing down from her gate as Philip cantered
up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Pegs!&quot; he said breathlessly.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Falconer greeted him coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo!&quot; she replied. &quot;Going for a walk?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What walk?&quot; asked the bewildered Philip.
&quot;Didn't you expect to meet me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly not. Why should I? I wasn't thinking
about you at all,&quot; replied Eve's daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you promised to meet me here at half-past
three,&quot; cried Philip in dismay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now it's a quarter to five!&quot; blazed Peggy,
abandoning her strategical position, woman-like,
in order to score a tactical point.</p>

<p class="indent">Sure enough, the sound of a church chime fell
musically on their ears through the still evening air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm awfully sorry,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn't matter at all,&quot; replied Peggy, still
inflexible. &quot;Good-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night!&quot; said Philip quietly. He was constitutionally
incapable of forcing his society where
it was not wanted. He turned to go. &quot;It's a pity
I'm late,&quot; he added regretfully. &quot;The most exciting
things have been happening, and I wanted to
tell you about them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
The small damsel's <i>hauteur</i> melted in an instant.
She deliberately resumed her perch upon the gate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can come and sit up here if you like,&quot; she
intimated, holding out her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip accepted the invitation with alacrity, but
the touch of Peggy's froggy paw brought a look of
concern into his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say,&quot; he said, &quot;you are cold! Put on my
greatcoat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy declined.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll want it yourself,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">But Philip was insistent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You simply must,&quot; he urged. &quot;You are shivering
all over. You can give me a corner of it to sit
on if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The argument came to an end, and presently
they were installed side by side upon the gate, like
two sociable sparrows. Peggy, whose teeth were
chattering, snuggled gratefully into the warmth of
the big coat, while Philip balanced himself on the
rail beside her, sitting on a very liberal allowance of
corner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you comfortable now?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Peggy gratefully. &quot;I'm glad you
came,&quot; she added with characteristic honesty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; enquired Philip. He did not know that
one must never ask a lady for her reasons.</p>

<p class="indent">But the little girl answered quite frankly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was getting frightened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And she slipped her arm round Philip's neck.</p>

<p class="indent">If Philip had been to a boys' school he would
have received this familiarity with open alarm or
resentment. Being what he was, nothing but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
very gallant little gentleman, he responded by
putting his own arm in a protective fashion round
his companion's slim shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now we are all right,&quot; he said comfortably.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me your news,&quot; commanded Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip related the whole amazing story. Peggy
listened breathlessly, her eyes and lips forming
three round O's. When the recital was finished, she
remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She must have been the lady Mother meant
when she said that was the question only one
woman could give the answer to only she never
would.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip, catching the general sense of
this unusual passage of syntax. &quot;It was the same
name&mdash;a funny name&mdash;Vivien.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know?&quot; asked Peggy curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Uncle Joseph told me all about her,&quot; said
Philip. &quot;I forgot, you haven't heard that bit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And at the pressing invitation of Miss Falconer,
he recited the tale of Colonel Meldrum's love-affair.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy's verdict came hot and emphatic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was a beast to treat him like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she has come back to him in the end,&quot;
said broader-minded Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will they get married, do you think?&quot; asked
Peggy, all in a feminine flutter.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip pondered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose so,&quot; he said at last. &quot;But they are
pretty old.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If they do,&quot; continued Peggy, &quot;what will
happen to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
Philip pondered again. Life had suddenly turned
a corner, and new vistas were opening before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;I don't want
to go back home at all. For one thing, I don't see
how I can. I have broken an order. I told Uncle
Joseph about meeting you, and he forbade me to
speak to you again so long as I lived under his roof.
I shouldn't have come this afternoon&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Peggy reproachfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can't disobey an order,&quot; explained Philip
gently. &quot;But when I saw Uncle Joseph and the
lady&mdash;like&quot;&mdash;he coughed modestly&mdash;&quot;like the
way they were, I thought I might.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He had broken his own orders,&quot; observed Miss
Falconer jesuitically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides,&quot; continued Philip, &quot;I am not going to
live under his roof any longer. I hate it all so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hate what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip recollected himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The work I have to do,&quot; he said. &quot;I used to
like it once; but now&mdash;now I don't think it is very
good work. Anyhow, I hate it. I can't go back to
it. I only went on because&mdash;well, because of Uncle
Joseph. He was very good to me, and I was some
use to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear, he won't want you now,&quot; said Peggy
shrewdly.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip was conscious of a sudden thrill.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won't he?&quot; he said. &quot;I never thought of that.
Then I <i>needn't</i> go back?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll have to go somewhere, though,&quot; observed
his sage counsellor. &quot;Where are you going to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to go about a bit. I have never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
even been to school. I don't know any other boys.
I want to grow up and be a man, and travel about
all over the world,&quot; said Philip, his eager spirit
dashing off into futurity at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; said Peggy, suddenly cold again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; continued Philip. He was fairly soaring
now. &quot;Have you read 'The Idylls of the King'?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy shook her head blankly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;Is it a story?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. It's all about a Round Table, and some
knights who met there. They used to ride out and
do the most splendid things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What sort?&quot; asked Peggy absently.</p>

<p class="indent">The sudden revelation of the eternal masculine
in Philip, exemplified by his desire to roam, was jangling
the chords of the eternal feminine in herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dangerous things,&quot; explained Philip enthusiastically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, they very often did them just out of
bravery; but the very best things a knight did were
always in honour of his Lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! Then you would require a Lady?&quot; said
Peggy, growing distinctly more attentive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather!&quot; said Philip. &quot;To serve, you know.
Whenever a knight performed any great deed he
wouldn't care anything about himself. He would
just feel he had done it for his Lady, and she would
reward him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip's brow wrinkled. He had not considered
the point before. With him, service always came
far above reward.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
&quot;Well,&quot; he said at last, &quot;she would praise him,
and go on being his Lady, and nobody else's.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this point in the conversation Philip was conscious
of a sudden constriction round his neck.
Peggy appeared to be about to make some remark;
but she relaxed her arm again, and enquired
calmly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When are you going to begin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall have to grow up a bit first, I suppose,&quot;
said the prospective Galahad regretfully. &quot;But I
don't want to go back to Uncle Joseph till then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should you?&quot; urged the small temptress
at his side. &quot;He won't require you now that his
Lady has come back to him. You are free to be
anything you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The difficult part,&quot; remarked the practical
Philip, &quot;will be to make a start at being anything.
To begin with, I don't know where to go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come to us,&quot; said Miss Falconer promptly.</p>

<p class="indent">Swiftly she sketched out her plans to her mesmerised
companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will take you up to the house now,&quot; she said.
&quot;I will put you into the studio: Dad is never there
after dark. You can stay all night&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She paused, and turned to Philip enquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won't be frightened?&quot; she enquired, half-apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Knights are never frightened,&quot; replied Philip
axiomatically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can sleep on the model-throne,&quot; continued
Peggy, taking all obstacles in her stride. &quot;I will
bring you in some supper, and no one will know.
Then, when Mother comes to see me in bed, I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
tell her about you, and we will settle what to do
next. But you mustn't&mdash;not on <i>any</i> account&mdash;let
Dad see you, or he would have one of his tempers.
Come on!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was almost dark by this time, and Peggy's
voice had sunk to an excited and ghostly whisper.
She dropped off the gate, dislodging her companion&mdash;who
it will be remembered had been accommodated
with a seat upon a portion of her apparel&mdash;with
some suddenness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are rather late,&quot; she said. &quot;I am not
allowed to stay out after dark. Let's run! Give me
your hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They trotted through the gloaming, and presently
came to a house standing by itself, well back
from the road. Breathing heavily, the two small
conspirators stole round to the north side of the
house, and presently came to a halt close under the
wall. Above their heads, eight feet up, Philip could
see a small window. It stood open.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take me on your back,&quot; said Peggy. &quot;Stoop
down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip obeyed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep <i>quite</i> steady!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By dint of much struggling, the agile Miss Falconer
succeeded in working her small but sharp
knees on to Philip's shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now!&quot; she whispered at length. &quot;Stand up
slowly, with your face to the wall!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip straightened his back laboriously, his fair
burden maintaining her balance by clinging to his
hair with both hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is a splendid adventure!&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
&quot;Rather!&quot; gasped Philip, with tears in his
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I am going to stand on your shoulders,&quot;
explained Peggy. &quot;Bend forward a little, with
your hands against the wall. Keep your head well
down, or I may tread on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two minutes after, the soles of the young lady's
shoes removed themselves from Philip's shoulder-blades
with a convulsive spring, and followed their
owner in a harlequin dive through the open window.
There was a dull thud on the floor inside,
followed by a brief silence. Then there was the
sound of some one moving in the dark, and presently
a French window further along the wall
swung open with a click, and Peggy, touzled but
triumphant, dragged her guest into the house.</p>

<p class="indent">The window closed, and a flood of electric light
swept away the darkness. Philip looked round
curiously. He had never been in a studio before.
The side of the room at which they had entered
was built out in the form of a penthouse, and was
roofed with glass. In the middle of the floor stood a
small platform, covered with a rug. On the platform
stood a sofa, and on the sofa reclined an eerie
figure, like a gigantic Dutch doll. Half-finished
canvasses&mdash;prospective wolf-scarers, no doubt&mdash;leaned
against the walls. In a corner lay an untidy
heap of robes and draperies.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon an easel close by the throne stood an
almost completed picture. It represented an infant
of improbably angelic aspect asleep in a cot, in
company with two golliwogs, a mechanical monkey,
and a teddy bear.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
&quot;That,&quot; remarked Peggy professionally, &quot;is a
wolf-scarer. It's called 'Strange Bedfellows.' It's
very pretty. It's nearly finished. This thing here is
a model-throne. You can sleep on it to-night.
Nobody will disturb you. Dad never comes here
until after ten in the morning, and none of the
maids are allowed in the studio at all. You will be
quite warm. I'll get you some of these robes and
things out of the corner. Ooh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, fascinated by his surroundings, had not
yet had time to notice his hostess. Now he turned
quickly. Miss Falconer was in a somewhat dishevelled
condition. Her red tam-o'-shanter was
white with plaster. Her frock was stained all down
the front, and one of her stockings had been cut
open right across the knee, displaying a crimson
bruise which threatened to deepen into purple.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have hurt yourself!&quot; cried Philip in great
concern.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I got a bit of a bump dropping through that
window,&quot; admitted Peggy, indicating the aperture
through which she had gained admission to her
home. &quot;But it doesn't hurt much, except when
you bend your knee suddenly. Now I must go and
have tea in the schoolroom. When I see Mother I
shall tell her about you, and she will know what to
do. If you hear anybody coming, turn out the light
and creep under the model-throne. It is hollow
underneath. I have often been there, playing at
robbers with myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip turned up the overhanging drapery, and
dubiously surveyed the grimy recesses of his last
refuge.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
&quot;Supposing I get underneath,&quot; he enquired,
&quot;and it turns out to be only you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy considered. Then her face dimpled. The
game of conspirators was, indeed, exhilarating.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall knock seven times on the floor with a
stick,&quot; she announced, &quot;before I come down the
passage. Then you will know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be splendid,&quot; agreed Philip. &quot;You
are awfully clever,&quot; he added admiringly, as the
directress of his fortunes turned to go.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy swung round again, with her fingers on the
doorhandle. A sudden rush of colour swept across
her face and neck, and for a moment her wide
brown eyes met Philip's. Then the lashes dropped
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Phil,&quot; she said shyly, &quot;I'll be your Lady
if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Next moment she was gone, and our knight,
feeling that he had been somewhat remiss in not
having made the suggestion himself, was left listening
to the sound of his Lady's feet limping down
the passage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>

<p class="h3">GENUS IRRITABILE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Montagu Falconer</span> had had a busy day. At
breakfast he had sent for, and sworn at, the cook.
The cook, who was a lady of spirit and accustomed
to being sent for, had reserved her defence until
the storm had spent itself, and then pointed out
with admirable composure and undeniable truth
that an omelette which is uneatable at a quarter to
ten may have been&mdash;and in fact was&mdash;in perfect
condition when placed upon the table at nine. She
then withdrew in good order, parrying the intimation
that she might take a month's notice, which
hurtled through the door after her, with the rejoinder
that she recognised no orders save those of
her mistress.</p>

<p class="indent">When she had gone, Mrs. Falconer said
calmly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn't give cook notice quite so often, old
man, if I were you. Some day she will take it, you
know, and then where will you be? Don't forget
her marrow-bones: they are the best in London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In reply Montagu Falconer picked up the omelette
between his finger and thumb and threw it
into the fire, where it created an unpleasant smell.</p>

<p class="indent">After this promising beginning, he proceeded to
his day's work. As he entered the studio he
noticed a middle-aged woman pass the window,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
supporting one end of a basket, at the other end of
which staggered a tumble-haired little girl. It was
the laundress, with her daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">The daughter was not too well dressed. She wore
a short and rather ragged frock, and had holes in
her stockings. But she was a picturesque little
figure, with a pretty face and wild coppery hair.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Falconer had intended to devote a sulphurous
morning to the completion of &quot;Strange
Bedfellows.&quot; This prospect possibly accounted for
the omelette incident, for Peggy's papa possessed
what is indulgently called a temperament, which,
being interpreted, means a dislike (from which
many of us less highly-strung people also suffer)
of performing uncongenial duties. But at the
sight of the little girl, his professional instincts despatched
him hot-foot through the French window
into the garden. Here, with much shouting
and redundancy of words, he secured from the
dazed but gratified parent, in return for an unnecessarily
generous fee, the services of her daughter
as model for a head-study.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll run 'er home and wash 'er face, sir,&quot; she
announced, &quot;and you shall 'ave 'er back in 'alf an
hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was better than her word. The little girl
returned in twenty-five minutes. Not only was her
face washed, but she wore her Sunday frock, together
with a pair of sixteen-button boots of patent
leather,&mdash;the patent upon which had palpably
expired,&mdash;once evidently the property of a lady of
fashion, and a tragic travesty of a toque. Under
her arm she bore her mother's umbrella; and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
wild mane was screwed into two tight pigtails,
fastened at the tips with bows of magenta ribbon.</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu Falconer, blaring like a bull, cast her
forth, weeping, to be intercepted and comforted
with clandestine cake by Mrs. Falconer at the back
door.</p>

<p class="indent">After this followed a savage onslaught, some
two hours in duration, on &quot;Strange Bedfellows,&quot;
which infuriated its creator so much that at luncheon
his wife was afforded a more than usually numerous
series of opportunities for &quot;making allowances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the afternoon there was a slight lull, for Montagu
betook himself and his temperament for an
airing on the Heath. He returned sheer drunk with
the glories of an autumn sunset, to make a heavy
and unwholesome tea. But in an evil moment he
asked for his daughter, and it was discovered that
she was not in the house. A hurricane sprang up in
a moment, increasing to a typhoon when Miss
Peggy arrived with a stained frock and a bruised
knee.</p>

<p class="indent">She was despatched incontinently to bed, where
cook and the housemaid and (later) her mother
combined to tend her wounds and supply her with
abundant, if surreptitious, refreshment.</p>

<p class="indent">After dinner Montagu Falconer found himself
in possession of a fresh grievance. His wife had
deserted him. As a rule she sat placidly upon the
other side of the fire and listened while her husband
derided the British Philistine and consigned the
Members of the Royal Academy, <i>seriatim</i>, <i>to</i> perdition.
But to-night even these simple pleasures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
were denied him. His wife's chair stood empty.
Probably she was upstairs, coddling that insubordinate
brat, Peggy. Her own husband, of course,
might shift for himself; he had no claim upon her
consideration. He was at liberty to slave day and
night to keep a roof over their heads; but when,
shattered by the magnitude of his exertions, he
returned to his own fireside for a few words of
wifely recognition and encouragement, what did he
find? An empty chair!</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder,&quot; he said, &quot;how high I might not have
climbed if I had been properly understood!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was so engrossed with this gratifying speculation
that he failed to hear seven portentous
thumps upon the floor of the passage leading to the
studio.</p>

<p class="indent">After another half-hour his sense of grievance
took a still more pathetic turn. He was now the
willing, patient, overdriven breadwinner, struggling
to keep an impoverished household together.
His part was to work, work, work, with none to say
him nay. Happy thought! He would go and work
now. Possibly if his wife found him, half-blind with
fatigue, toiling at his easel at midnight, she might
feel sorry. Anyhow, he would try it.</p>

<p class="indent">Feeling comparatively cheerful, and ignoring the
fact that one does not usually paint by artificial
light, the downtrodden breadwinner proceeded to
the studio. He stepped softly, for he did not want
his wife to hear him at present. She was to discover
him later, when his stage effects had been
properly worked up.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
To his surprise he noted a light under the studio
door. Who could it be? The servants were strictly
forbidden to enter the sacred apartment at all. It
seemed too much to hope that it might be cook.
His eyes gleamed, and he turned the handle softly.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip was sitting upon the sofa on the model-throne,
partaking of chicken-and-ham and cocoa
with an air of romantic enjoyment. He had now
been an inmate of the studio for four hours, but
Peggy had not returned to him. Instead, a kindly,
cheerful lady, with steady eyes and a humorous
mouth, bearing sustenance upon a tray, had paid
him a lengthy visit. To her Philip had recounted
the full tale of Uncle Joseph, not omitting the
Beautiful Lady, but suppressing the nature of
Uncle Joseph's profession and his own part therein.
This was unfortunate, for had he not done so Mrs.
Falconer would have pointed out to him what he
had so far failed to realise&mdash;namely, that as the
Beautiful Lady had walked in at the door, Uncle
Joseph's old life had flown out of the window, and
that Aubrey Buck, Tommy Smith, <i>et hoc genus
omne</i>, were no more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will think things over in the night watches,&quot;
said Mrs. Falconer, &quot;and in the morning I will
come and tell you what to do. Now, you queer
little mortal, eat up your supper and go to sleep.
As you have no mother, do you think I might give
you one kiss?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That was half an hour ago.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip was conscious of a slight draught upon the
back of his neck, which was turned towards the
door. Hardly had he realised this when he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
aware of an inarticulate roar; and into his field of
vision there bounded a gentleman with a golden
beard and a fiery eye, wearing a black velvet dinner-jacket.
This was doubtless Pegs's father, and
from external evidence he was suffering from one of
his &quot;tempers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What the Blazing Henry are you doing here?&quot;
bawled the gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip replied politely that he was having supper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supper?&quot; yelled Montagu Falconer. &quot;How
dare you have supper in my studio? How dare
you bring your filthy food in here? Tell me that!&quot;
His eye fell upon the tray, suggesting a fresh outrage.
&quot;Where did that supper come from?&quot; he
demanded. &quot;Where from, you mooncalf?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It came along that passage,&quot; replied the mooncalf,
taking a drink of cocoa.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy's papa waved his arms and raved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Curse you!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Don't drink cocoa
in my presence! It is a beastly habit and a beastly
beverage. It's my cocoa, too!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was getting cold,&quot; explained Philip, in
extenuation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And don't answer back!&quot; bellowed the master
of the house. &quot;Don't answer back, or I'll brain
you&mdash;like&mdash;like this!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He snatched a mediæval mace from off the wall,
and, to Philip's intense gratification, proceeded to
pound an Etruscan vase into smithereens.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are you?&quot; he continued. &quot;Who are you,
to go filibustering all over my house? Who are you,
to insinuate your disgusting presence into my
kitchen and forage among my household stores?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
Philip, still keeping a hopeful eye on the mediæval
mace, considered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm a boy,&quot; he said cautiously.</p>

<p class="indent">This eminently reasonable explanation only
exasperated Mr. Falconer still further.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you are <i>not</i>!&quot; he bawled. &quot;You are a
criminal! Do you know I have a wife and daughter&mdash;let
alone a staff of young and innocent servants?
Supposing one of them had seen you? You might
have frightened them all out of their wits&mdash;you
toad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Falconer stamped up and down the room,
plainly meditating further acts of violence. Philip,
realising that his host had not yet been taken into
the confidence of his wife and daughter regarding
the present situation, decided to be cautious.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the fermenting Montagu came to a
standstill.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you come here at all?&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wanted somewhere to sleep,&quot; replied Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu uplifted clenched hands to heaven.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unutterable dolt!&quot; he roared. &quot;Do you imagine
you are in a common lodging-house?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, sir,&quot; Philip assured him. &quot;I like your
pictures awfully,&quot; he added, with a friendly smile.</p>

<p class="indent">This time Montagu Falconer first gaped at him,
and then enquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you a <i>crétin</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, who did not know what a <i>crétin</i> was,
shook his head dubiously, and said he was not sure.
Mr. Falconer, after assuring him that there was no
doubt on the matter whatever, continued his cross-examination.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
&quot;Where the devil have you come from? I suppose
you know <i>that</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I came from Hampstead,&quot; replied Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you live in that beastly spot?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have to live somewhere,&quot; the <i>crétin</i>
pointed out gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why not go on living there, you unspeakable
Yahoo? Why leave your antimacassars, and
china dogs, and wool mats, and wax fruit, and&mdash;and
harmoniums, and come bursting into a civilised
household&mdash;eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have run away from home,&quot; said Philip simply.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Falconer uttered a yell of triumph.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A-a-ah! <i>Now</i> we are getting at the facts. What
is your address?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip told him.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Falconer assumed an air of ferocious satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Admirable!&quot; he cried; &quot;most inexpressibly satisfactory!
You are outwitted! I have over-reached
you&mdash;criminal! To-night, since you desire it,
you shall enjoy my hospitality; but to-morrow
morning, on the stroke of nine, an officer of the
law&mdash;a policeman&mdash;shall wait upon you and
conduct you back to the slum from which you
came. Meanwhile, wretched offal, sleep! Sleep
all over the studio if you like, and be damned to
you! To-morrow&mdash;<i>ad leones</i>! Good-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And without another word this excellent but ill-balanced
householder shot out of the studio into
the passage, locking the door behind him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
Philip finished the last piece of ham and the last
mouthful of cocoa, turned out the electric light,
rolled himself up in a Greek robe of saffron serge,
and lay down upon the sofa. He was concerned in
his mind about several things. In the first place,
he had been discovered, and that might mean
trouble both for Peggy and her mother. In the
second the door was locked, which meant that he
was a prisoner. In the third, he was to be sent back
to Uncle Joseph at nine o'clock next morning,
which would be an ignominious ending to his first
great adventure. He pondered.</p>

<p class="indent">In due course, just before he fell asleep, his
obvious and proper course of action occurred to
him. It was the only way, he decided, and moreover
promised further adventure. He would have
liked to be able to say good-bye to Peggy,
but....</p>

<p class="indent">His eyes closed, and he slipped into the dreamless,
motionless sleep of tired childhood, the lay
figure and the other Strange Bedfellows keeping
watch and ward by his pillow.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>

<p class="h3">THE ECCENTRIC GENTLEMAN</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a lovely morning. Philip, tramping vigorously
along a Hertfordshire highway, felt that if all
his adventures were to be conducted under such a
kindly sun as this he would have little to complain
of. But at present his most pressing desire was to
get as far away from the residence of Mr. Montagu
Falconer as possible.</p>

<p class="indent">He had quitted that restful establishment some
three hours previously, escaping from durance by
the simple expedient of opening the French window
and walking out on to the lawn. He had caught an
early morning train into the country; and having
travelled as far as one-and-ninepence would carry
him, had also covered a considerable distance upon
two sturdy legs. But he was uneasily conscious of
the avenging power of the Law, which, goaded into
activity by his late host,&mdash;Heaven only knew on
what charges,&mdash;might be interesting itself on his
behalf over all the countryside.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, he felt that he had no alternative. If he
had accepted Mr. Falconer's pressing invitation to
remain and be arrested at nine o'clock that morning,
a still more involved situation would have
arisen. For one thing Pegs and Mrs. Falconer
would have been dragged into the fray, which
would have been a most unnecessary complication;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
for apparently their choleric but obtuse protector
had not scented their presence in the plot at all.
They would certainly have confessed complicity
and taken Philip's side; and this would have led to
a domestic upheaval of a most monumental character.
So Philip had cut the Gordian knot by running
away.</p>

<p class="indent">It was eleven o'clock. He had breakfasted off
the very inconsiderable remains of his supper, and
was now acutely conscious of the existence of an
excellent digestion clamouring for employment.
He tramped resolutely along the wide country road,
fingering the sum of elevenpence which remained
in his right-hand trouser pocket, and wishing he
could come to a shop.</p>

<p class="indent">He also speculated as to his future. He was a
clear-headed little boy, and though he had led a
secluded life, he had spent it almost entirely with
grown-up people, and was accustomed to marshalling
facts and weighing probabilities. He ran
over the list of his accomplishments and limitations.</p>

<p class="indent">He had no Latin or Greek, but was a good stenographer
and typewriter. He could keep accounts
and file correspondence with method and neatness.
He was a promising mathematician, with a useful
but unsystematic acquaintance with mechanics
and physics. He had read and re-read some
twenty of Shakespeare's plays. He knew long
passages of Milton and Tennyson by heart, and
was well up in the history of ancient chivalry. His
favourite book was Sir Thomas Malory's &quot;Morte
d'Arthur&quot;; next in order ranked a string of well-thumbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
science manuals. It may be added that
he had never read a novel in his life. The foundation-stone
of nine novels out of ten is a woman, and
the coping-stone thereof is love made perfect; so
naturally such works had found no place upon
Uncle Joseph's shelves.</p>

<p class="indent">He was fairly expert with singlestick and rapier,
and could play piquet and double-dummy bridge
with more than average skill. But he knew nothing
of cricket and football; and the ordinary joys of the
schoolboy's holidays&mdash;pantomimes, parties, and
the like&mdash;were a sealed book to him.</p>

<p class="indent">His labours on behalf of the Kind Young Hearts
and Thomas Smith had introduced him to a large
and varied, if unusual, circle of acquaintance, and
he possessed a knowledge of human nature and the
world in general that a seasoned man about town
might have envied.</p>

<p class="indent">For some time back his thoughts had been occupied
with the contemplation of a suitable career.
The profession of Knight Errantry having apparently
fallen into desuetude, he had been compelled
to resign himself to the prospect of a more humdrum
occupation. With the true instinct for the
surviving possibilities of romance, he had decided
to become an engineer. Like all boys of the present
age he was consumed with the desire to understand,
direct, and control machinery&mdash;especially the
machinery of the automobile. The numerous cars
which whizzed up and down the Finchley Road
were an abiding joy to him. He could tell the make
of any of them&mdash;just as a woman can tell the
make of another woman&mdash;by the cut of its bonnet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
Number plates attracted him especially, for they
stimulated his imagination. When a mud-splashed
car displaying the letters &quot;S.B.&quot; stole silently past
him in the gathering darkness, he realised with a
thrill the bigness of the world; for this weary giant,
now slipping into the roaring heart of London, had
come all the way from the fastnesses of Argyllshire.
He paid a penny a week for a small but highly
technical journal which dealt with the latest mode
in such things as sleeve-valves and detachable
rims. He even executed designs of his own, inventing
tyres which never punctured and carburettors
that never choked. So now, with the choice of a
career suddenly thrust upon him, he had no difficulty
in making up his mind. It had been made up
for some time. At this very moment he was on his
way to Coventry, whence he knew that vast numbers
of motor-cars emanated. What he was going
to do when he got there he had not definitely settled.
He felt that he already possessed certain saleable
merchandise in the form of clerical skill: this
he proposed to barter for technical instruction. He
would arrange details when he reached Coventry.
Philip was essentially one of those people who
decline to think of the Vistula until they have
crossed the Rhine.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he came to an old, lofty, and warmly
tinted brick wall, skirting the road for nearly a
quarter of a mile on his right, and evidently sheltering
some venerable house and garden. As he
approached, Philip observed a large notice-board,
jutting out for all to see.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span></p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">MOTORISTS</p>

<p>Please drive slowly along<br />
this wall. It contains<br />
two hidden gates.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">A quarter of a mile farther on, where the wall
ended, came another board, which said, simply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">THANK YOU!</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Philip's comment on this pretty device was
characteristic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a beast you would feel,&quot; he said to himself,
&quot;if you <i>didn't</i> drive slowly and then found
that 'Thank You!' sticking out at the end!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made a mental note that if ever he possessed
a car of his own and came to this wall, he would
comply punctiliously with the request upon the
first board and so earn the right to read the second.
He added a rider to the effect that if ever he possessed
a house of his own like that he would put out
a similar board.</p>

<p class="indent">He had scarcely passed the second of the concealed
gates&mdash;the first was a mere kitchen door&mdash;when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
there was a grinding of bolts, and the gates
were dragged open, slowly but resolutely, first one
and then the other, by a small but intensely fat
girl of seven or eight. This proceeding exposed
to view the front of an ancient and ivy-clad house.
Exactly opposite to the front door stood a motorcar
of antique design and dilapidated appearance.
From beneath the car projected a pair of human
feet, attached to a pair of lengthy legs. The owner
of the legs was apparently doing something painful
to the underbody of the car, from beneath which
came a stream of objurations of a bloodthirsty but
innocuous type, punctuated by the clink of a
spanner.</p>

<p class="indent">The small girl, breathing heavily, stooped down
to inspect these operations. Presently, adopting
a more comfortable but somewhat reptilian attitude,
she crawled bodily under the car. Here she
encountered the head of the mechanic, who was
lying on his back, engaged apparently in the task of
removing mud-stalactites from the bottom of the
car with a spanner. As fast as the stalactites were
dislodged they fell into the excavator's eyes or
mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doin' of, Daddy?&quot; enquired a
husky but interested voice in his ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eating mud,&quot; replied the mechanic. &quot;Splendid
thing for the digestion, Dumps. Have some?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thank you,&quot; was the dignified reply. &quot;I
shall be havin' a glass of milk soon. But I will
watch you,&quot; added Miss Dumps indulgently.</p>

<p class="indent">She rolled over with some difficulty on to her
back, and lay staring solemnly at the mud-encrusted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
vault above her, while her harassed
parent resumed his task of digging with the spanner
for a buried nut.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've opened the gates, Daddy,&quot; announced the
small lady presently, in tones which were intended
not so much to convey information as to remind
her companion that he was forgetting his duties as
a conversationalist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, madam,&quot; replied Mr. Mablethorpe.
&quot;Is the road clear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I seen a little boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trust you for that! Well, we must contrive
not to run over him. Just look in my left ear and
see if you can find a nut, there's a good girl. I
rather fancy I heard it drop in just now. No, don't
bother. Here it is in my eye. Now we are really
getting on!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He adjusted the nut to the now exhumed bolt,
and began to screw it tight with the spanner. The
recumbent Dumps turned her head and regarded
him admiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are clever, Daddy!&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right,&quot; admitted her parent modestly.
&quot;I am a wonder. People simply come miles to&mdash;Dash
and confound the rotten thing! Run your
finger round the inside of my collar, Daniel Lambert.
I think I can feel it lying somewhere round at
the back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Once more the fugitive nut was recaptured and
replaced&mdash;this time permanently. Mr. Julius
Mablethorpe wriggled painfully from under the
car on the gravel drive, and then, rising to his legs,
politely dragged his daughter out by the heels, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
having first stood her upon her head (in order, as he
explained, to give her feet a rest) restored her to an
upright position, and surveyed her doubtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall get into trouble with Mother, Dumpling,&quot;
was his first remark.</p>

<p class="indent">He was right. At that moment the front door
opened, and Mrs. Mablethorpe appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can only say, Julius,&quot; she began at once,&mdash;as
a matter of fact, no one had invited her to say
anything.&mdash;&quot;that I am not in the least surprised
at anything you may do; but I <i>think</i>&quot;&mdash;her voice
quavered tearfully&mdash;&quot;that you might have had
the sense to prevent that child from crawling about
in the mud too. Baby, go into the house and ask
nurse to give you a bath at once. Your hands and
face are black!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am quite white, Mummy,&quot; replied Miss
Dumpling soothingly (one soon picked up the habit
of speaking soothingly to Mrs. Mablethorpe), &quot;all
over the rest of myself. Look, I'll show you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before any one could stop her, the infant detached
a stocking from its moorings and rolled it
down to her ankle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There!&quot; she said triumphantly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Mablethorpe, fearing further enterprise,
hurriedly reiterated her ultimatum on the subject
of a bath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A good hot one,&quot; she added.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The kiddie would do much better to wash her
hands and face in cold water,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe.
&quot;What she is covered with is chiefly oil,
and hot water will only open her little pores and
drive it in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
Mrs. Mablethorpe put her hand to her head,
dizzily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know I cannot bear argument, Julius,&quot;
she said, with a little moan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sorry!&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe humbly. &quot;We
must do as we are told, Dumps. We will go upstairs
and wash in hot water. Then we shall have
black hands and faces for months and months,
and Mother won't be able to take us to Church.
Hurrah!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And this undutiful parent and callous husband
caught up his daughter on his shoulder and carried
her, shrieking joyfully, to the nursery. Five
minutes later he descended, clean and smiling, and
after caressing his hypochondriacal spouse, set to
work to start up his engine. After three back-fires
this feat was accomplished, and the car, with much
burring of gear-wheels and slipping of the clutch,
started off upon its deafening career. The vehicle
in question was an old friend, and like most old
friends felt privileged to speak its mind on all
occasions, which it did with no uncertain voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe, having safely negociated the
gateway,&mdash;no light feat, considering the amount
of play on his steering-wheel,&mdash;turned sharp to
the right and proceeded northward. Presently he
came to four cross-roads. At the foot of the signpost
sat a small, sturdy, and well-dressed boy, with
short, curly, red hair and hazel-green eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">As the car slowed down in case of cross traffic
the boy rose to his feet, and ranging up alongside
asked a polite question.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe leaned over as far as he could.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
&quot;Is it <i>very</i> important?&quot; he yelled above the din.
&quot;If I stop this engine to listen to you I may never
be able to start it again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip replied with the full pressure of his lungs,
but the only distinguishable word was &quot;Coventry.&quot;
The amiable Mr. Mablethorpe accordingly
switched off the current, and the engine clanked
itself into a state of coma.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now let us hear all about it,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you please tell me the way to Coventry?&quot;
enquired Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Coventry&mdash;eh? Have you been sent there?&quot;
Mr. Mablethorpe's eye twinkled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I'm going of my own accord,&quot; said Philip
innocently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First time I have heard of a man sending himself
to Coventry,&quot; mused Mr. Mablethorpe. He
surveyed Philip's bewildered face with interest.
&quot;Perhaps you don't catch the allusion, though.
Don't you ever send any one to Coventry at
school?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have never been to school, sir,&quot; replied
Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's a pity,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe. &quot;But
to resume. Coventry must be a good eighty miles
from here. Do you propose to walk?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe eyed the pedestrian curiously.
&quot;Running away?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sort of,&quot; admitted Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I have only one motto in life,&quot; said Mr.
Mablethorpe, &quot;and that is, 'Mind your own business!'
So I will refrain from comment. I don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
know where Coventry is, but I should think you
would not go far wrong if you kept along this road,
and asked again later. Now, with your permission,
I must be getting on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe had not proceeded far on his
way&mdash;to his surprise and gratification the engine
had come to life almost immediately&mdash;when his
conscience smote him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might have offered the little beggar a lift,&quot; he
said to himself. &quot;Silly not to have thought of it.
He has a longish journey before him&mdash;that is, if
Papa doesn't lay him by the heels. I might stop
and let him overtake me. I wonder where he
is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He leaned over the side of the car and surveyed
the road behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">The car, which had been waiting for some such
opportunity as this all morning, promptly mounted
the footpath and charged a hedge. Fortunately it
was climbing a hill on its first speed at the time, so
the results of the impact were not serious.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe, who was quite accustomed to
mishaps of this kind, stopped his engine, and descended
to earth to review the situation.</p>

<p class="indent">The first object which met his eye was Philip&mdash;a
little blown and obviously taken by surprise&mdash;standing
in the road with one hand still upon the
Cape-cart hood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo!&quot; remarked Mr. Mablethorpe genially.
&quot;Still here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Philip. &quot;I thought I would run
behind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Better come and sit in front,&quot; advised Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
Mablethorpe. &quot;But first of all we must get Boanerges
out of the hedge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Boanerges. Let me introduce you. I present
Boanerges&mdash;my superb, four-seated, two-cylinder,
one dog-power reaping machine&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philip Meldrum.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;To Mr. Philip Meldrum. Now you know one
another. (At least, Boanerges knows you: you
don't know Boanerges.) Come and help to shove
his ugly face in!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip assisted his new and eccentric friend to
disentangle Boanerges from the hedge and push
him back into the roadway, and then obediently
took his seat. He was trembling with pure ecstasy.
He was in a motor-car! At last he had stepped from
textbooks into the realms of reality.</p>

<p class="indent">He surveyed the various appliances on the dingy
dashboard. There were two switches of the electric
light variety, one marked &quot;M&quot; and the other &quot;A,&quot;
which Philip knew stood for Magneto and Accumulator
respectively. There was an oil-reservoir, with
a piston-rod protruding from the top, and a glass
gauge at one side to show the level of the oil. Last
of all, suspended from its tail by a drawing pin,
came a clockwork mouse, which had originally
been the property of the Dumpling and was now
spending its declining years as a motor-mascot.
Meanwhile Mr. Mablethorpe, with the assistance
of the starting-handle, had been playing a monotonous
and unmelodious tune upon his hurdy-gurdy-like
engine. Presently he paused for breath.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
&quot;Boanerges takes a lot of starting-up,&quot; he
explained. &quot;I'll have one more go, and if that
fails we will run him backwards down the hill and
let the reverse in. That ought to do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you running on magneto or accumulator,
sir?&quot; enquired Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe left the starting-handle and
came thoughtfully round to the side of the car.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't seem to be running on either,&quot; he
remarked. &quot;My mistake! Let us try this little
fellow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned down the switch marked &quot;A,&quot; and returned
to his labours. The immediate result was a
stunning explosion immediately under Philip's feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the first gun,&quot; explained Mr. Mablethorpe.
&quot;He always gives us three before we start.
The first is a protest; the second means '<i>Drop it, or
there will be trouble!</i>' and the third usually ushers in
a conflagration. After that I blow the flames out,
and off we go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But this was too sanguine an estimate. After
five resounding back-fires the engine still failed to
exhibit any signs of abiding vitality, although the
accumulator had been reinforced by the magneto.
Mr. Mablethorpe accordingly took his seat at the
wheel and, releasing the brakes, allowed the car to
slide rapidly backward down the hill. At the same
time he performed some complicated evolutions
with his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly the engine sprang into life, and Boanerges,
with a playful swerve, shot stern foremost
into a bank at the other side of the highway, with a
bump which nearly sent Philip back-somersaulting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
into the seat behind. The engine immediately
stopped again.</p>

<p class="indent">That resourceful but unconventional mechanic,
the owner of the car, abandoned his pedal-work,
descended once more into the road, and after dispassionately
kicking Boanerges three times in the
pit of his stomach&mdash;the radiator&mdash;seized the
starting-handle and gave it another resolute twirl.</p>

<p class="indent">This time his efforts were successful beyond all
expectation. Boanerges promptly charged forward,
nearly pinning his tormentor beneath his off-front
wheel, and proceeded smartly up the hill once
more, Mr. Mablethorpe running frantically alongside
and endeavouring to climb into the driver's
seat over the spare wheel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another little mistake of mine,&quot; he panted, as
he finally hopped on board and took the wobbly
steering-wheel over from Philip. &quot;I left the gears
in the first speed instead of the neutral. But it is
all right now. We are off like an Arab steed. Let
me oil him up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He leaned forward and began to agitate the
piston in the oil-reservoir, with the result that
Boanerges, emitting dense fumes of black smoke
from his exhaust, was soon breasting the slope with
quite remarkable vigour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you know something about motors?&quot; said
Mr. Mablethorpe, as they reached the top of the
hill and began to slide comfortably down the other
side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only out of books,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I have never
been in a car before, but I think I understand the
way the engine works, and the ignition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
Mr. Mablethorpe surveyed him admiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wonderful!&quot; he said&mdash;&quot;wonderful! Fancy
any human creature being able to understand
textbooks! They simply prostrate <i>me</i>. I dare say,&quot;
he added enviously, &quot;that you know what poppet-valves
are! And worm-drives, and differential
sprockets! Prodigious!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only by what I have read about them in a
book,&quot; explained Philip modestly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; continued Mr. Mablethorpe. &quot;I know
of one thing you never read about in a book, and
that was a car like this. Boanerges was built
before the printing-press was invented&mdash;in the
dark ages&mdash;in the days of the Black Art. Look at
those two switches, marked 'M' and 'A.' They
stand for 'Mephistopheles and Apollyon'&mdash;the
name of the firm who supplied the engine. Oh, it's
an eerie vehicle, this. Observe this pedal. You
wouldn't think a pedal could do more than just go
up and down, would you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It might take out the clutch, or put on the
brake, sir,&quot; hazarded Philip respectfully.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe waved his hand contemptuously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;Steady, old man!&quot;
(This to Boanerges, who, feeling his owner's grip of
the wheel relax, had swerved quite thirty degrees
out of his course.) &quot;This car was designed by a
man without hands or arms&mdash;only feet and teeth.
At least, I think so. His idea was to steer with his
teeth and do everything else with his feet. So he
started by abolishing gear-handles and side-brakes,
and applied all his ingenuity to the pedals. Look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
at this one,&mdash;the left. If I push it half-down the
car stops. If I push it two thirds down, the car
starts again&mdash;in the opposite direction&mdash;and the
engine plays <i>I wish I was an Angel</i>, instead of
<i>Hitchy Koo</i>! We have a lot of fun in close traffic
that way. If I push it seven eighths down, the
radiator boils over, and I can have a shave or a cup
of tea; and if I put it right down, the car turns
inside out and becomes a portable camp bedstead.
I won't do that at present, because I am not
sleepy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All this surprising information was communicated
with an air of solemn and confidential conviction;
and Philip, who had never previously
encountered any one endowed with Mr. Mablethorpe's
peculiar brand of humour, merely gaped
dumbly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Boanerges is a car of mystery,&quot; continued
this excellent but frivolous man presently. &quot;There
is a little handle-arrangement down here, in the
corner of the dashboard. I don't know who put it
there: I just noticed it one day, after I had owned
the car for some time. I have only turned it three
times. The first time the whole of the back axle
dropped off into the road. The second time Boanerges
turned right round and ran over a duck which
was asleep on a cottage doorstep behind us. The
third time a policeman with a notebook shot
straight up out of the roadway in front of the car,
and took my name and address for obstructing a
funeral which had been trying to pass me for two
hours. That was about seventeen years ago, just
after I bought the car. At least, I didn't buy it: it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
was left to me by my great-grandmother. I have
never meddled with that handle since.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, who had lived in serious company hitherto,
and had no idea that grown-up people ever
descended to imbecility of this description, began
to like this strange gentleman. But he made no
attempt to maintain a conversation with him.
After the dictatorial austerity of Uncle Joseph he
felt pleasantly intoxicated by his present companion's
frothy effervescence, and was well content to
lean back in his seat and listen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; resumed Mr. Mablethorpe presently,
&quot;I may be wrong about the designer of this
car having had no arms. He may have required
them&mdash;one of them, at any rate&mdash;for other purposes.
For instance, he may have been engaged
to be married. Are you engaged to be married, by
any chance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe appeared to fall into a fresh
train of thought, and after a little while enquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is your opinion of the female sex as a
whole?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not long ago Philip could have given his opinion
on this subject clearly and concisely. Now he was
content to quote the words of another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't quite know,&quot; he said, &quot;but Uncle
Joseph thinks&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He hesitated. Mr. Mablethorpe might not be
interested in Uncle Joseph.</p>

<p class="indent">But this astonishing gentleman appeared to be
interested in everybody.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
&quot;Tell me all that Uncle Joseph thinks,&quot; he
commanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Uncle Joseph,&quot; began Philip, &quot;used to wonder
why women were ever created.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe turned and regarded his small
companion sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aha! Uncle Joseph used to wonder that, did
he? Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said,&quot; continued Philip, warming to his
subject as the familiar phrases came back to him,
&quot;that there is no parallel to the female mind in any
other branch of Nature.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true,&quot; remarked Mr. Mablethorpe
approvingly. &quot;I should like to meet Uncle Joseph.
Go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems incredible,&quot; pursued Philip, with a
curiously incongruous expression of intense wisdom
upon his honest and ingenuous features, &quot;that
Providence should handicap its own beautifully
designed human engines by placing them in daily
contact with such a piece of uncontrolled and ill-balanced
mechanism as Woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oho!&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe, manipulating
the oil-pump, to the noisome satisfaction of Boanerges;
&quot;Uncle Joseph said that, did he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; and he said putting women near a man
was like putting a lot of bar-magnets round a compass.
And he said they were parasites, too, actuated
by predatory instincts. They&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Mr. Mablethorpe interrupted him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Uncle Joseph, I take it,&quot; he said, &quot;is a married
man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no,&quot; replied Philip, &quot;he is a bachelor. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
never allows a woman into his house, even to wash,&mdash;at
least, he never did until the other day, when
the Beautiful Lady came. And then&mdash;well, I
didn't know what to think, sir,&quot; he concluded
helplessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This,&quot; commented Mr. Mablethorpe, &quot;is elliptical
but interesting. Proceed, my infant misogynist.
Who was the Beautiful Lady, and why did
she call?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Philip, knitting his brows, &quot;it
was like this. No woman is ever&mdash;was ever&mdash;allowed
into our house, because&mdash;because of what
Uncle Joseph thinks&mdash;thought&mdash;about them. Yesterday
a lady called when he was out, and got in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who let her in?&quot; enquired the accusing voice
of Mr. Mablethorpe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid I did, sir,&quot; replied Philip apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not in the least surprised to hear it,&quot; said
Mr. Mablethorpe. &quot;What was she like?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was all in black, and she sat and talked to
me for a long time, and told me she had lost her
little girl. Then Uncle Joseph came in, and&mdash;and&mdash;and
they seemed to know each other quite well,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe deliberately switched off his
engine and slowed down to a stop at the roadside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now we can talk without shouting,&quot; he said.
&quot;I scent copy. This is a real live Romance. Continue.
How well did Uncle Joseph and the Beautiful
Lady appear to know one another?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pretty well,&quot; faltered Philip, with boylike
reserve.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
Mr. Mablethorpe, who had once been a boy
himself,&mdash;there were some who said that he had
never grown up,&mdash;nodded understandingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what happened after that?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ran away,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They did not seem to need me any more,&quot; said
Philip simply.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe produced a pipe, and filled it
with great care. He appeared to be thinking
deeply about something. Presently, after lighting
the pipe, he turned to Philip, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you in a pressing hurry to get to Coventry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip thought not, and said so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why not come and stay with me for a
bit?&quot; suggested this amazing man.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<p class="h3">RED GABLES</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">An</span> hour later, shopping commissions having
been executed, they clanked majestically homeward.
The journey was completed without further
mishap, though a frisky calf, encountered by the
way, almost wrecked its own prospects of ever
becoming veal by an untimely indulgence in the
game of &quot;Come to Mother, or Last Across the
Road,&quot;&mdash;that was how Mr. Mablethorpe described
it,&mdash;gambolling unexpectedly under the
very bows of Boanerges in response to the ill-judged
appeal of an anxious parent on the opposite
side of the highway.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the long red wall, with its polite notice
to motorists, came into view on their left, and the
car slowed down. Philip realised with pleasure
that this was his destination.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you put up that notice, sir?&quot; he enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I put it up,&quot; replied Mr. Mablethorpe, &quot;but
my daughter composed it. She makes rather a
special feature of the common courtesies of life.
Mind your elbow against that gatepost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two minutes later Philip found himself being
presented to a languid but still pretty lady, who
assured him, in a speech which appeared in some
curious way to be addressed to Mr. Mablethorpe
rather than himself, that she was charmed to meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
him, in spite of a headache, and that she had no
doubt that fresh servants would ultimately be
forthcoming to take the places of those whose resignations
the introduction of an unexpected boy into
a hitherto tranquil household would naturally
precipitate. Adding a mournful postscript to the
effect that Philip would doubtless have made an
admirable secretary for her husband, but for the
fact that his uncle would inevitably insist upon his
speedy return to Holly Lodge, Mrs. Mablethorpe,
with a look of patient endurance upon her delicate
features, faded away upstairs, to bedew herself
with eau-de-Cologne and partake of luncheon in
bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Friends,&quot; observed Mr. Mablethorpe solemnly
as his wife disappeared, &quot;are requested to accept
this (the only) intimation and invitation. Now,
Philip, come and be introduced to my daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The three spent a perfectly happy afternoon
together. Miss Dumpling treated &quot;the new inmate,&quot;
as Mr. Mablethorpe called Philip, with
marked favour, introducing him <i>seriatim</i> to three
cows, named respectively Boo, Moo, and Coo; a
family of lop-eared rabbits; and an aged gramophone
suffering from bronchial weakness.</p>

<p class="indent">Towards tea-time Mr. Mablethorpe, who knew
his wife almost as well as he loved her, penetrated
to the invalid's bedroom, and there apologised in
the most handsome manner for several crimes
which he had not committed. Mrs. Mablethorpe,
having delivered herself of a brief homily upon the
whole duty of a husband entrusted with the care of
a delicate wife, now felt sufficiently recovered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
come downstairs and partake of a tea of encouraging
dimensions.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip surveyed her curiously. His feminine
horizon was enlarging itself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Julius, dear,&quot; observed Mrs. Mablethorpe
presently, &quot;I know, of course, that it is perfectly
useless to say anything to you about Baby's upbringing,&mdash;the
child is ruined for life by this time,&mdash;but
I must protest, however feebly, against
your feeding her with that sweet and sticky cake.
We shall have her running in and out of the dentist's
every five minutes in a year or two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You hear that, Daniel Lambert?&quot; asked Mr.
Mablethorpe of his ruined child. &quot;Mother says
we aren't to have any more cake. I think it is
most tyrannical of her: she knows how we love
running in and out of the dentist's. But we must
obey orders. About turn, and let us get back to
the bread-and-butter! Come on&mdash;I'll race you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe began to munch bread-and-butter
with enormous enthusiasm, and poor
Dumps, reluctantly laying down a generous slice
of plum-cake, followed his example. But when the
trio finally obtained permission to retire to the
library and play at &quot;wolves&quot;&mdash;a pastime to
which it appeared that Mr. Mablethorpe was much
addicted&mdash;and tumbled upstairs together, Philip
overheard the unregenerate father whisper to his
daughter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you wish a wish and then feel in my pocket,
old lady, you may find something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the library the Dumpling offered Philip a
share in a large slice of plum-cake.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
Philip went to bed that evening in the room
which had been prepared for his reception (fortunately
without causing any break-up in the staff of
the establishment), but did not sleep for a long
while. He had much to think of. It seemed almost
incredible that he had left Holly Lodge only yesterday,
and that it was only last night that he had
slept with the wolf-scarers in Montagu Falconer's
studio; yet it was a fact. The remembrance of the
studio brought back visions of Peggy. He wondered
when, if ever, he should see her again. He
compared her with Dumps, but quickly realised
that comparisons were impossible. Dumps was a
decent little kid, though fat, but she was not Pegs.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he thought of Dumps's parents, and he
began to understand that it takes all sorts to make
a world. He was beginning to realise the importance,
in every department of life, of &quot;making
allowances.&quot; This duty was not confined to one
sex, as he had previously imagined. Mrs. Falconer,
it was true, spent her life in making allowances for
Mr. Falconer. But here was Mr. Mablethorpe
doing precisely the same thing for Mrs. Mablethorpe.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, he thought of Uncle Joseph and the
Beautiful Lady. Perhaps, he reflected, if these
two had made allowances for one another earlier in
life their coming together would not have been
delayed for ten years.</p>

<p class="indent">Incidentally he made a note that, dragons having
become obsolete, a knight might do worse than set
out to persuade people to make allowances for one
another.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE OFFICIAL DEMISE OF TOMMY SMITH</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Mr. Mablethorpe, after a quite
unexpectedly serious conversation with Philip,
departed upon Boanerges to seek out Uncle Joseph.</p>

<p class="indent">Having achieved a comparatively unadventurous
journey (if we except a collision with a milk-cart in
the Finchley Road), he drew up at Holly Lodge,
which looked very much the same as when Philip
had left it two days before, save that a large board,
newly painted and announcing that &quot;This House&quot;
was to be &quot;Let or Sold,&quot; projected over the laurel
hedge which separated the gravel sweep from the
roadway.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph was at home, and received his
visitor in the library.</p>

<p class="indent">The owner of Boanerges came to the point at
once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My name,&quot; he said, &quot;is Mablethorpe. I do not
suppose that the information will interest you in
the least, but it is customary to give it. What is
more to the point is the fact that I have found a
stray nephew. Have you lost one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph admitted that this was so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He appears to have left home,&quot; continued Mr.
Mablethorpe, &quot;two days ago, owing to a sudden
and rather unexpected change in your domestic
routine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
&quot;He told you the story, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot quite understand,&quot; said Uncle Joseph,
&quot;why the event to which you refer should have
made it necessary for him to leave my house. In
fact, I should have thought it would have been an
inducement to him to remain. Have a cigar?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe helped himself, and replied
thoughtfully:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I gather that the&mdash;the event to which we have
referred absolved him, in his rather immature
judgment, from further allegiance to your person
and service.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph eyed his visitor keenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Service&mdash;eh? Did he explain to you the
nature of his services?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he told me all about it. The Kind Young
Hearts, the Unwanted Doggies, Tommy Smith&mdash;everything.
I made him tell me every shred of the
story. I would not have missed a word of it. It was
priceless&mdash;immense&mdash;the most brilliant thing I
ever heard of! As a brother-artist, in a smaller and
less remunerative way, I beg to offer you my felicitations
and thanks. But our young friend Philip
appears to have found his share of the work uncongenial.
Apparently his conscience&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not his conscience,&quot; interposed Uncle Joseph:
&quot;his disposition. The boy is a born sentimentalist,
like his father before him. I had noticed the paternal
characteristics developing for some time, and I
expected an upheaval sooner or later. The&mdash;the
event to which reference has been made precipitated
matters, that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
&quot;Quite so,&quot; agreed Mr. Mablethorpe. &quot;But
whatever his underlying forces may be, your
nephew appears to be a youth of some directness
of character. When I intercepted him yesterday
he was on his way to Coventry, with the intention
of studying the mechanics of automobilism. He is
now in my house, and on my representations has
agreed to place his future unreservedly in your
hands. But I don't think you will persuade him to
go back to the Little Tommy Smith business, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no need,&quot; said Uncle Joseph. &quot;Little
Tommy Smith is dead, and his works have perished
with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I had gathered,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How?&quot; asked Uncle Joseph, a little startled.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe waved his hand in the direction
of the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Partly from the presence of that board outside,&quot;
he said, &quot;and partly because, in the light of&mdash;of
recent events, any other <i>dénouement</i> would
have been an inartistic anticlimax, contrary to the
canons of the best fiction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph surveyed his rather unusual visitor
with interest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You appear to know something of men and
women,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have to,&quot; explained Mr. Mablethorpe. &quot;I
make a living by studying the weaknesses of mankind
and publishing the results of my observations
at four-and-sixpence net.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A novelist, I gather.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but of the obsolete school. I hate your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
morbid, soul-dissecting, self-centred pessimist like
poison. I go in for happy endings and the eternal
good in human nature. In this respect I rejoice
to observe that you are not going to disappoint
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Joseph's cold blue eyes glowed suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thank God!&quot; he said; &quot;I am not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After that he told Mr. Mablethorpe the rest of
the story.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her husband died five years ago. I rather
gather it was drink, but I did not press the point.
I am quite content to accept the official virtues of
the deceased as enumerated on his tombstone and
let his hobbies drop into oblivion. She had one
little girl, who died, too; and since then she has
been living alone&mdash;quite alone. Poor soul, she
has paid&mdash;paid in full. Perhaps I have, too.
Pride, pride! Have you ever noticed, in your observations
of human life, how very heavily&mdash;disproportionately,
one might say&mdash;God punishes
pride? Sins which arise from weakness seem to get
off, on the whole, rather more lightly than they
deserve; but the sins of the strong&mdash;pride, obduracy,
even reticence&mdash;never! I suppose it is
God's way of rubbing in the fact that Strength
Belongeth to the Lord Alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't think that the strong get punished more
heavily than the weak,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe,
&quot;but they feel their punishment much more
keenly. It is impossible to punish the weak. They
run howling to their betters the moment they feel
the first whack, and unload their woes on to them.
But the strong, especially the proud, endure their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
punishment and say nothing. That's why it hurts
so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you are right,&quot; said Uncle Joseph.
&quot;But we appear to be digressing into philosophy.
I am to be married next month, and we are going to
live in the country. She has been left very poorly
off, as the money has passed on with the title. But
I think we shall be tolerably comfortable&mdash;and
busy. We have some small arrears of happiness to
make up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And your benevolent exercises,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe,
after a long silence, &quot;are now a thing
of the past?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Frankly, I am sorry; for the people who
paid the money extracted a large amount of innocent
pleasure from giving it, and it was a perfect
godsend to the people who ultimately received it.
But, of course, pedantically speaking, the whole
thing was illegal, and Vivien has all a woman's
respect for the letter of the law. So I intend to
close down. My charities will suffer, I fear; but
possibly I shall be able to make good by personal
service some of the deficiencies caused by my failure
as a source of revenue. Still, I shall miss it all.
I enjoyed composing the appeals, particularly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I rather fancy I once received one from you,&quot;
said Mr. Mablethorpe. &quot;I read it with great appreciation.
In fact, I answered it. But now, as to
Master Philip. What are your views?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supposing I hear yours first?&quot; said Uncle
Joseph.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well. I am a comparatively prosperous
man. I have no son. The boy interests me, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
scent copy in him. I also want an occasional secretary
and amanuensis. I suggest that he should
make his headquarters with me, and I will be
responsible for his education. He shall visit you
whenever and for as long as you want him. The
only stipulation I make is that we have no formal
agreement or business arrangement about him. I
am not a man of business, and I hate legal contracts
and attempts to harness the future more
than anything in this world. Will you let me have
the boy for as long as he is willing to stay with
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Uncle Joseph.</p>

<p class="indent">And with that word Philip's career as a misogynist
and recluse came to an official conclusion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE GOLDEN AGE</p>

<p class="h3">I</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Philip's</span> life during the next ten years resembled
All Gaul. It was spent partly at a little house in
Cheltenham, whither Uncle Joseph, with all his
old austerity and cynicism thawed out of him, had
conducted the Beautiful Lady two months after
their marriage; partly at Red Gables; and partly
at a series of educational establishments, ranging
from a private school in the neighborhood of St.
Albans, where he was initiated into the mysteries
of Latin Prose and cricket, to the great engineering
shops of the Britannia Motor Company at Coventry.</p>

<p class="indent">Life at Red Gables was a very pleasant business.
Philip's duties as secretary were of an elastic nature.
Sometimes he wrote out cheques for tradesmen
and coaxed Mr. Mablethorpe into signing
them. Sometimes he battled with publishers about
copyrights and royalties. Sometimes he acknowledged
the receipt of the letters&mdash;chiefly from seminaries
for young ladies&mdash;of those who wrote to express
their admiration of Mr. Mablethorpe's works.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose, Philip,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe one
morning, ruefully surveying a highly scented missive
in a mauve envelope, forwarded by his publishers,
&quot;that my books <i>are</i> read by other people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
besides schoolgirls; but why in Heaven's name
should no one else ever write to me about them?
Not that I want any one to write at all,&mdash;the
penny post is the curse of modern civilization,&mdash;but
I could do with a touch of variety now and
then. I have only once in my life received a letter,
as an author, from a man, and that was from a
pork-butcher in the north of England, who wrote
to point out, most helpfully and sensibly, that I
was guilty of a technical error in making my hero
purchase both kidneys and bacon at the same shop.
I should like to get a lot of letters like that: they
are extremely valuable. But what <i>do</i> I get? Letters
by the score from schoolgirls&mdash;sometimes
from a syndicate of schoolgirls&mdash;all asking for my
autograph and endeavouring to find out, by more
or less transparent devices, how old I am and
whether I am married or not! You can't choke
them off. If you don't answer they write again,
enclosing a stamped envelope, which hangs round
your neck like a millstone for weeks. If you do,
they tell all the other girls, and before you know
where you are you find you have tapped Niagara.
Let us see what Zenana has found me out now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He opened the mauve envelope, and read the
letter with savage grunts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This, Philip,&quot; he said, &quot;is from Gwendoline
Briggs and Clara Waddell. You will be interested
to hear that they sit up reading my innocuous
works in the dead of night, after the other girls
have gone to sleep. Well, I hope the Head Mistress
catches them at it, that's all!... Here you are:
what did I tell you?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">... <i>We often wonder what you are like. One of us thinks
you are about forty, with rather tired grey eyes</i>&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Impudent minx!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&mdash;<i>but the other thinks you are much younger than that;
clean-shaven, with a very firm mouth</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;This sort of thing makes me quite sick.... Yes,
I thought as much; they want my autograph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>Will you please send two, please, as we are not sisters&mdash;only
great chums.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where do these brats hail from?&quot; Mr. Mablethorpe
turned back the page and consulted the
heading of the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Bilchester Abbey School, Bilchester, Hants.</i>
That's a new name to me. Throw over that directory,
Philip: on the third shelf, to your right.
Let me see: <i>Founded, 1897. Governing Body: the
Lord Bishop of</i>&mdash;&mdash;quite so: <i>Head Mistress, Miss</i>&mdash;&mdash;yes,
yes: <i>Assistant Mistresses</i>&mdash;never mind them:
<i>Gravel soil; Gymnasium; Altitude, four hundred</i>&mdash;Ah,
here we are:&mdash;<i>Number of Pupils, two hundred
and seventy-three!</i> Great Heavens! This must be
stopped. Get the typewriter quickly, Philip, and
take down something!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>Mr. Julius Mablethorpe regrets deeply that he is unable
to accede to the request of Mesdames Briggs and Waddell
for his autograph. Mr. Mablethorpe had the misfortune
some years ago to be deprived of the use of his hands (owing
to an explosive fountain-pen), and now finds himself compelled
to dictate all his work into a gramophone. Mr. Mablethorpe
is seventy-eight years of age, and is still in
possession of a fair proportion of his faculties. His eyes</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
<i>used to be grey, as Miss Briggs (or was it Miss Waddell?)
surmises; but he now possesses only one, having lost the
other while on a visit to a Dorcas Society, together with a
portion of his scalp. He has been married four times, and
possesses sixty-nine grandchildren, reckoning thirteen to
the dozen. For further details see &quot;Who's Who.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;That ought to choke them off,&quot; observed Mr. Mablethorpe
with childish satisfaction, as he finished
dictating this outrageous document. &quot;Now,
what about this grubby epistle here? It does not
smell so vilely as the first, but I bet it is from another
of the tribe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He began to read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>Dear Mr. Mablethorpe</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>All your books are in our House Library&mdash;</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">He broke off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell you what it is, Philip,&quot; he said. &quot;I shall
have to write a really shocking novel&mdash;something
unspeakably awful. Then I shall be banned from
girls' schools for ever. My circulation will probably
go down by ninety per cent, but it will be well
worth it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>My name is Elsie Hope, and I love them all. I have no
father or mother, and I have just read a story of yours about
a little girl who had no father or mother either. It made me
cry.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Snivelling brat!&quot; commented the unfeeling
author.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>I have not been here very long, and I do not know many
of the girls yet, so your books make splendid company. I
thought I would like to tell you. Good-bye.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
&quot;Gracious!&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe incredulously.
&quot;She hasn't asked for my autograph!
Hello, what's this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned over the page. The letter continued,
in a different handwriting&mdash;prim, correct, and
formal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>Elsie has gone to bed. I found her writing this letter, and
she showed it to me quite frankly. As the child seemed
really eager to write to you, I have undertaken to finish her
letter and explain the circumstances. I feel sure you will
understand, and pardon the liberty. Do not trouble to reply.</i></p>

<p class="signature"><i>Yours faithfully</i></p>

<p class="author"><i>Ellen Wardale.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe laid down the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ellen Wardale is a good sort,&quot; he said. &quot;As for
Elsie Hope, she has not asked me to write to her,
so I shall do so. Now, Philip, get out &quot;The Lost
Legacy,&quot; and we will have a go at Chapter Fourteen.
It is going to be a difficult bit. The hero, who
is the greatest nincompoop that I have yet created,
finds himself suspected by the heroine of having
transferred his affections to another lady. (Between
ourselves, it would have been a very sensible
thing if he had done so, but, of course, he is incapable
of such wisdom.) As the story is not half over,
we can't afford to get him out of the mess just yet;
so this morning I want him to make an even greater
ass of himself than before, and so prolong the agony
to eighty thousand words. Here goes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After this they would work steadily until lunchtime.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span></p>

<p class="h3">II</p>

<p class="indent">Philip had other duties to perform. He attended
to the wants of Boanerges, and in time reduced
that unreliable vehicle to quite a surprising degree
of docility.</p>

<p class="indent">He became gradually infected with the Romance
of our mechanical age. He saw himself, a twentieth-century
Galahad, roaming through the land
in a hundred-horse-power armoured car, seeking
adventure, repelling his country's invaders, carrying
despatches under cover of night, and conveying
beauteous ladies to places of safety. He spent
much of his spare time seated upon the garden wall,
watching for the motors that whizzed north and
south along the straight white road. (It is regrettable
to have to record that many of these disregarded
Dumps's notice-board.) He saw poetry in
the curve of a radiator, and heard music in the
whirring of a clutch.</p>

<p class="indent">One day, in an expansive moment, he confided
these emotions to Mr. Mablethorpe. That many-sided
man did not laugh, as Philip had half-feared
he would, but said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Romance brought up the nine-fifteen</i>&mdash;eh? I
must introduce you to a kindred spirit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And he led Philip to a shelf filled with a row of
books. Some were bound in dark blue, and consisted
mainly of short stories; the others, smaller
and slimmer, were dark red, and contained poetry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe, &quot;are the works
of the man whom I regard as the head of our profession.
Wire in!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
Philip spent the next three days learning &quot;MacAndrew's
Hymn&quot; by heart.</p>

<p class="indent">There were many other books in the library,
upon which Philip browsed voraciously. Uncle
Joseph's selection of literature had been a little
severe, but here was far richer fare. Philip discovered
a writer called Robert Louis Stevenson, but
though he followed his narratives breathlessly
found him lacking in feminine interest. The works
of Jules Verne filled him with rapture; for their peculiar
blend of high adventure and applied science
was exactly suited to his temperament. He had
other more isolated favourites&mdash;&quot;The Wreck of
the Grosvenor&quot;; &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;; &quot;The Prisoner
of Zenda&quot;; and &quot;To Have and to Hold,&quot; which
latter he read straight through twice. But he
came back again and again to the shelf containing
the red and blue volumes, and the magician
who dwelt therein never failed him. There were
two fascinating stories called &quot;The Ship that
Found Herself,&quot; and &quot;.007.&quot; After reading these
Philip ceased to regard Boanerges as a piece of
machinery; he endowed him with a soul and a
sense of humour. There was a moving tale of love
and work called &quot;William the Conqueror&quot;; there
was a palpitating drama of the sea called &quot;Bread
upon the Waters&quot;; and there was one story which
he read over and over again&mdash;it took his thoughts
back in some hazy fashion to Peggy Falconer and
Hampstead Heath&mdash;called &quot;The Brushwood
Boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Only one book upon this shelf failed to please
him. It was a complete novel, and dealt with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
love affair that went wrong and never came right.
The hero, a cantankerous fellow, became blind,
and the unfeminine independent heroine never
knew, so went her own way and left him to die.
This tragic tale haunted Philip's dreams. It
shocked his innate but unconscious belief in the
general tendency of things to work together for
good. He considered that the author should have
compelled these two wrong-headed people to
&quot;make allowances for one another,&quot; and so come
together at the last. He even took the opinion of
Mr. Mablethorpe on the subject. Mr. Mablethorpe
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His best book, Philip. But&mdash;I read it less than
any of the others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he introduced Philip to &quot;Brugglesmith,&quot;
and the vapours were blown away by gusts of
laughter.</p>

<p class="h3">III</p>

<p class="indent">Philip's orthodox education was not neglected.
After a year's attendance as a day-boy at the establishment
near St. Albans he was sent to Studley,
a great public school in the south of England.</p>

<p class="indent">Here many things surprised him.</p>

<p class="indent">Having spent most of his life in the company of
grown men, he anticipated some difficulty in rubbing
along with boys of his own age. Master Philip
at this period of his career was surprisingly grownup:
in fact he was within a dangerously short distance
of becoming a prig. But he went to school in
time. In three weeks the latent instincts of boyhood
had fully developed, and Philip played Rugby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
football, indulged in unwholesome and clandestine
cookery, rioted noisily when he should have been
quiescent, and generally tumbled in and out of
scrapes as happily and fortuitously as if he had
been born into a vigorous family of ten.</p>

<p class="indent">He achieved a respectable position for himself
among his fellows, but upon a qualification which
would have surprised an older generation. The
modern schoolboy is essentially a product of the
age he lives in, and the gods he worships are constantly
adding to their number. Of what does his
Pantheon consist? Foremost, of course, comes the
athlete. He is a genuine and permanent deity. His
worshippers behold him every day, excelling at
football and cricket, lifting incredible weights in
the dormitory before going to bed, or running a
mile in under five minutes. His qualifications are
written on his brow, and up he goes to the pinnacle
of Olympus, where he endures from age to age.
Second comes the boy whose qualifications are
equally good, but have to be accepted to a certain
extent upon hearsay&mdash;the sportsman. A reputed
good shot or straight rider to hounds is admitted
to Olympus <i>ex officio</i>, and is greatly in request, in
the rôle of Sir Oracle, during those interminable
discussions&mdash;corresponding to the symposia in
which those of riper years indulge in clubs and
mess-rooms&mdash;which invariably arise when the
rank and file of the House are assembled round a
common-room fire, in the interval, say, between
tea and preparation.</p>

<p class="indent">There are other and lesser lights. The wag, for
instance. The scholar, as such, has no seat in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
sun. His turn comes later in life, when the athletes
are licking stamps and running errands.</p>

<p class="indent">But the Iron Age in which we live has been responsible
for a further addition to the scholastic
aristocracy&mdash;the motor expert. A boy who can
claim to have driven a Rolls-Royce at fifty miles
an hour is accorded a place above the salt by popular
acclamation. No one with any claim to social
distinction can afford to admit ignorance upon
such matters as high-tension magnetos and rotary
valves. The humblest fag can tell at a glance
whether a passing vehicle is a Wolseley or a Delaunay
Belleville. Science masters, for years a despised&mdash;or
at the best a tolerated&mdash;race, now
achieve a degree of popularity and respect hitherto
only attainable by Old Blues, because they understand
induced currents and the mysteries of internal
combustion. Most curious portent of all, a
boy in the Lower School, who cannot be trusted to
work out a sum in simple arithmetic without perpetrating
several gross errors, and to whom physics
and chemistry, as such, are a sealed book entitled
&quot;Stinks,&quot; will solve in his head, readily and correctly,
such problems as relate to petrol-mileage or
the ratio of gear-wheels, and remedy quite readily
and skilfully the ticklish troubles that arise from
faulty timing-wheels and short circuits.</p>

<p class="indent">It was upon these qualifications that Philip
originally obtained admission to the parliament
which perennially fugged and argued around the fire
on winter evenings. It was true that he had never
been fined for exceeding the speed limit in Hyde
Park, like Ashley major, nor been run into in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
Ripley Road, like Master Crump; but his technical
knowledge was very complete for a boy of his age;
and being an admirable draughtsman, he could
elucidate with paper and pencil mysteries which
both he and his audience realised could not be explained
by the English language.</p>

<p class="indent">In time, too, he became a fair athlete. Cricket
he hated, but he developed into a sturdy though
clumsy forward at football; and his boxing showed
promise. His speciality was the strength of his
wrist and forearm. On gala nights, when the prefects
had been entertaining a guest at tea,&mdash;an
old boy or a junior master,&mdash;Philip, then a lusty
fag rising sixteen, was frequently summoned before
the quality, to give his celebrated exhibition of
poker-bending.</p>

<p class="indent">Having discovered that the boys at Studley were
much more grown-up than he had expected, Philip
was not altogether surprised to find that some of
the masters were incredibly young&mdash;not to say
childish. There was Mr. Brett, his Housemaster.
Mr. Brett was a typical product of a great system&mdash;run
to seed. British public schools are very
rightly the glory of those who understand them, but
they are the despair of those who do not. Generally
speaking, they produce a type of man with no
special propensities and consequently no special
fads. He has been educated on stereotyped and
uncommercial lines. He is not a specialist in any
branch of knowledge. His critics say that he is unfitted
for any profession; that he cannot write a
business letter; that he is frequently incapable of
expressing himself in decent English. But&mdash;public-school
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
tradition has taught him to run straight
and speak the truth. The fagging system has
taught him to obey an order promptly. The prefectorial
system has taught him to frame an order
and see that it is carried out. Games have taught
him to play for his side and not for himself. The
management of games has instilled into him the
first principles of organisation and responsibility.
Taking him all round, he is the very man we want
to run a half-educated empire.</p>

<p class="indent">Possibly these truths had been known to Mr.
Brett in his early days. But, as already stated, his
principles had run to seed. In the vegetable world,&mdash;of
which schoolmasters are dangerously prone
to become distinguished members,&mdash;whenever
judicious watering and pruning are lacking, time
operates in one of two ways. A plant either withers
and wilts, or it shoots up into a monstrous and unsightly
growth. In Mr. Brett's intellectual arboretum
every shrub had wilted save two&mdash;Classics
and cricket. These twain, admirable in moderation,
had grown up like mustard trees, and now
overshadowed the whole of Mr. Brett's mental outlook.
In his House he devoted his ripe scholarship
and untiring care exclusively to boys who were
likely to do well in the Sixth: his mathematicians
and scientists were left to look after themselves.
French and German he openly described as &quot;a sop
to the parental Cerberus.&quot; His Modern-Side boys
forgave the slight freely&mdash;in fact, they preferred
it; and their heavily supervised classical brethren
envied them their freedom. But cricket was a different
matter. Mr. Brett had probably begun by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
regarding Classics as the greatest intellectual, and
cricket as the greatest moral, stimulus in the
schoolboy world&mdash;a common, and, on the whole,
perfectly tenable, attitude of mind. But by the
time that Philip came under his charge it is greatly
to be feared that he regarded both as nothing more
than a means to an end&mdash;Classics as an avenue to
Scholarships and House advertisement, cricket as
an admirable instrument wherewith to lacerate the
feelings of other Housemasters.</p>

<p class="indent">Cricket was rather overdone at Studley in those
days. There were cricket leagues and cricket cups
innumerable. Play was organised exactly like
work: the control of their pastimes was taken from
the hands of the boys themselves and put into the
hands of blindly enthusiastic masters. Masters
flocked on to the field every afternoon and bowled
remorselessly at every net. Healthy young barbarians
who did not happen to possess any aptitude
for cricket, and whose only enjoyment of the game
lay in the long handle and blind swiping, were compelled
to spend their allotted ten minutes standing
in an attitude which made it impossible for them to
slog the ball, listening giddily the while to impassioned
harangues upon the subject of playing forward
and keeping a straight bat. Cricket, thus
highly officialized, soon began to be accepted by
the boys as a mere extension of school routine; and
being turned from play to work was treated by
them as they treated Cæsar and Euclid&mdash;that is
to say, they did just as much as they were compelled
to do and no more. But their enthusiastic
preceptors took no account of this. They glowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
internally to think how unselfishly they were devoting
their spare time to improving the standard
of school cricket,&mdash;as, indeed, they were,&mdash;and
cementing the <i>entente cordiale</i> between master and
boy,&mdash;as most assuredly they were not. It did not
occur to them that it is possible to have too much
of a good thing. Nine boys out of ten would have
been grateful enough for half an hour's coaching a
week; but to be compelled to spend every afternoon
repressing one's natural instincts, debarred,
by that unwritten law which decrees that no boy
may address his fellows with any degree of familiarity
in the presence of a master, from exchanging
the joyous but primitive repartees and impromptus
of the young, struck the most docile Studleian as
&quot;a bit too thick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Worse still, these excellent men quarrelled
among themselves as to the respective merits of
their pupils. Many a humble fag, contentedly supping
off sweet biscuits and contraband sardines in
the privacy of his study, would have been amazed
(and greatly embarrassed) if he had known that his
merits as a leg-break bowler were being maintained
or denied with the utmost vehemence over Common
Room port by two overheated graduates of
Oxford University. Housemasters plotted and
schemed to have the dates of matches put forward
or set back, in order that some star performer of
their own, at present in the sick-house or away
at a funeral, might be enabled to return in time
to take part in the fray. Elderly gentlemen who
ought to have known better rose straight from
their knees after evening prayers and besought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
their pupils to make runs for the honour of the
House.</p>

<p class="indent">Into this strange vortex the unsuspecting Philip
found himself whirled. His first term was comparatively
normal. He went to Studley in January,
and being, as already recorded, a healthy young
animal, soon found his place among his fellows. Of
Mr. Brett he could make little or nothing. He was
by reason of his training in many ways a grown-up
boy. There were times when the cackle of the
House Common Room bored him, at which he
would have enjoyed a few minutes' conversation
with an older man&mdash;say upon the morning's news,
or some book recently disinterred from the top
shelf of the House library. But intercourse with
his Housemaster was not for him. Mr. Brett, finding
that Philip knew little Latin and no Greek, had
dismissed him abruptly to the Modern Side, as one
of that noxious but necessary band of pariahs
whose tainted but necessary contributions make it
possible for the elect to continue the pursuit of
Classics. As for Philip's football promise, it was
nothing to Mr. Brett. This most consistent of men
considered the worship of football &quot;a fetish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All hope of further intimacy between this antagonistic
pair ended during the following summer term,
when to Philip's unutterable amazement, Mr. Brett
declined to speak to him for the space of three days,
because Philip, by inadvertently running out the
most promising batsman on his side in the course
of a Junior House League match, had deprived Mr.
Brett of a possible two points out of the total necessary
to secure the Junior House Cricket Cup. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
incident did not disturb Philip's peace of mind to
any extent. It merely crystallised his opinion of
his Housemaster. He possessed a large measure of
his uncle's gift of terse summarisation of character.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This chap,&quot; he observed to himself, &quot;is the
most almighty and unutterable sweep in the scholastic
profession, besides being a silly baby. I must
turn him down, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Henceforward Philip went his own way. He met
his Housemaster but seldom, for he was naturally
excluded from such unofficial hospitalities as Sunday
breakfasts and half-holiday teas. Neither did
the two come into official collision, for Philip was
a glutton for work and reached the top of the Modern
Side by giant strides. The only direct result of
their strained relations was that Philip was not
made a prefect when the time came. Mr. Brett
could not reconcile his conscience to placing in a
position of authority a boy who was neither in
Classic nor a cricketer, who was lacking in <i>esprit-de-corps</i>,
and made a fetish of football and science.</p>

<p class="indent">But Philip was contented enough. True, he
could not take his meals at the high table, neither
could he set fags running errands for him, but he
possessed resources denied to most boys. He became
the devoted disciple of one of the junior Science
masters, Mr. Eden, who, almost delirious with
joy at having discovered a boy who loved Science
for its own sake and not merely because the pursuit
thereof excused him from Latin Verse, took
Philip to his bosom. Under his direction Philip
read widely and judiciously, and was permitted in
fulness of time to embark upon &quot;research work&quot;&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
is, to potter about the laboratory during his
spare hours and make himself familiar with the use
and manipulation of every piece of apparatus that
he encountered.</p>

<p class="indent">He had his friends in the House, too. There was
Desborough, a big lazy member of the Fifth, the
son of an Irish baronet, much more interested in
sport than games, though he was a passable enough
athlete. Desborough disliked the rigidity of Mr.
Brett's régime, and pined occasionally for the spacious
freedom of his country home, with its dogs
and guns by day, and bridge and billiards in the
evening. Then there was Laird, a Scot of Scots,
much too deeply interested in the question of his
future career as a Cabinet Minister to suffer compulsory
games and unprofitable conversation with
any degree of gladness. And there was Lemaire,
the intellectual giant of the House, who, though
high up in the Sixth, was considered by Mr. Brett
to have forfeited all right to a position of authority
among his fellows by having been born into the
world with a club foot. But though he could play
no games, Lemaire exacted more respect and consideration
from the House than Mr. Brett dreamed
of, for he possessed a quick wit and a blistering
tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">It was with these three that Philip foregathered
during his later years at school. The Quartette, as
they were called, resembled second-year undergraduates
rather than third-year schoolboys in
their attitude to life and their methods of recreation.
Being endowed with no authority they escaped
the obsession of responsibility which lies so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
heavily upon the shoulders of youthful officialdom,
and they conformed to the rules of the House and
School with indulgent tolerance, observing the
spirit rather than the letter of the law. Which was
just as well, for boys in their position could have
done incalculable harm had they felt so disposed.
The prefects were secretly afraid of them, and left
them to themselves. The House as a whole venerated
them, especially Philip and Desborough,
and would gladly have been admitted to greater
intimacy. But the Quartette would have none
of them. They preferred to hold aloof from the
turbulent <i>camaraderie</i> of the Common Room and
congregate in one or other of their studies, where
it was rumoured that they talked politics.</p>

<p class="indent">But rumour was wrong, or at any rate only
partially in possession of the facts, as you shall
hear.</p>

<p class="h3">IV</p>

<p class="indent">The Studley masters were not a particularly
gregarious body. The Head lived in secluded state
with his wife and four daughters in his official residence
on the north side of the Close, emerging periodically
to overawe the Sixth, preach in Chapel, or
discharge a thunderbolt in Big School. The Housemasters
dwelt severally in their own strongholds,
thanking Heaven that their Houses were not as
other Houses were; and the Junior Staff lived
roundabout, in cottages and chummeries and snuggeries,
throughout Studley Village.</p>

<p class="indent">But once a week the whole hierarchy foregathered
in the Masters' Common Room and dined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
together. Usually the Head presided in person;
and from the soup to the savoury every soul present
talked shop.</p>

<p class="indent">Schoolmasters appear to be quite unique in this
respect. For three months on end they live in everlasting
contact with boys. Sleepy boys confront
them in those grisly hours of school which occur
before breakfast. Restless and inattentive boys
occupy their undivided attention from breakfast
until luncheon. In the afternoon they play games
with, or watch games played by, energetic and
overheated boys. From four o'clock till six they
stimulate the flagging energies of boys who are
comfortably tired and inclined to be drowsy. In
their spare time they lavish individual pains upon
backward boys, or castigate sinful boys, or fraternise
with friendly boys, or comfort unhappy boys.
At the very end of the day they pray with and for
all the boys together.</p>

<p class="indent">A man who has never been a schoolmaster might
be excused for supposing that when this overdriven
band desisted from their labours and sat down to
their evening meal, they would turn with a sigh of
relief to some extraneous and irrelevant topic&mdash;politics;
literature; sport; scandal, even. But no&mdash;they
never talk of anything but boys&mdash;boys'
work, boys' games, boys' pranks, boys' crimes,
boys' prospects. They bore one another intensely,
these excellent men; for just as no young mother
ever desires to hear of or talk about the achievements
of any other baby than her own, so no keen
cricketing coach will listen with anything but impatience
to glowing accounts of his next-door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
neighbour's protégés. But they never desist. The
shop varies, but boy is the only theme.</p>

<p class="indent">This weakness is not confined to schoolmasters,
of course. All bodies of men of the same calling
herded together for protracted periods of time are
inclined to the habit, but most of them take elaborate
precautions to eradicate it. In military and
naval circles, for instance, certain subjects are tabu.
Even undergraduates mulct one another in pots of
beer if the line be crossed. But schoolmasters are
incorrigible. They talk boy and nothing else. The
explanation is simple. Boys are the most interesting
things in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Studley Senior Common Room was no exception.
At the top of the table the Head and his
senior colleagues discussed high-school politics&mdash;scholarships,
roseola, and the latest eccentricity of
the Governing Body. About the middle of the
table, where housemasters and form-masters were
intermingled, a housemaster would explain to a
form-master, with studious moderation and paternal
solemnity, that owing to the incompetence,
prejudice, and spite of the form-master a certain
godly and virtuous youth named Jinks <i>tertius</i> was
making no progress in his studies, and was, moreover,
acutely depressed by the injustice with which
he was being borne down. In reply to this the
form-master would point out in the most courteous
and conciliatory tones, that the said Jinks was an
idle young scoundrel, and that until the housemaster
abandoned his present short-sighted and
officious policy of habitually intervening between
Jinks and his deserts,&mdash;to wit, the rod,&mdash;no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
further progress could possibly be expected. Why
couldn't housemasters back form-masters up a
bit? And so on. Lower down the table, three
single-minded partisans were hotly disputing as to
whether, upon a given date last summer, in a given
junior inter-form cricket match, one Maggs (of the
Lower Remove) did or did not feloniously give one
Baggs (of the Upper Fourth) out leg-before-wicket
at the instigation of a muscular bowler named
Craggs. The only two persons at the table who were
not talking boy were Mr. Chigley and Mr. Cleeve.
Mr. Chigley, between mouthfuls, complained bitterly
and unceasingly of the food; while Mr. Cleeve
remorselessly conducted an inattentive audience,
hole by hole, step by step, stroke by stroke, through
the intricacies of a battle fought by himself against
apparently incredible odds that afternoon&mdash;and
of a victory snatched away on the last green, seemingly
by the sudden and officious intervention of
Providence, after what must have been one of the
worst and most uninteresting exhibitions of golf
ever seen.</p>

<p class="indent">Dinner ended, the company dispersed abruptly,
summoned back from refreshment to the neverending
labours of the schoolmaster, by House-prayers,
scholarship coaching, or the necessity of
administering justice. Mr. Brett and two other
housemasters were invited by the Head to a rubber
of bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the way,&quot; observed the great man as they
cut for partners, &quot;you fellows must really see that
your boys wear greatcoats on their way up to and
down from football. Last Saturday I noticed four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
or five young idiots, in a most overheated condition,
standing about on Big Side watching the
Fifteen without so much as a sweater among them.
It nearly gave me pneumonia to look at them. You
and I, I think, Brett. We have choice of seats.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I will sit away from the fire,&quot; said Mr.
Brett. &quot;My deal, I think. Will you cut to me,
Haydock? Personally, I never permit any boy in
my House to go up to the playing-fields without his
greatcoat. Hearts!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My feeling in the matter,&quot; said Mr. Allnutt, on
Brett's left, &quot;has been, and always will be, that we
coddle boys a great deal too much. In my young
days at&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hearts!&quot; repeated Mr. Brett loudly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In my young days at Chiddleham,&quot; pursued
Mr. Allnutt, quite unruffled, &quot;sweaters had not
been invented, and&quot;&mdash;he threw out his chest
proudly&mdash;&quot;we were none of us a penny the worse.
Shall I play to a heart, partner?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you please,&quot; said Mr. Haydock patiently.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Brett played the hand and won the odd trick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The nuisance about occasional apparel, such
as a greatcoat,&quot; said Mr. Haydock, gathering up
the cards, &quot;is that a boy wears his some wet morning
up to school, and at the end of the hour, finding
that the sun is shining and being a forgetful animal,
comes down without it. Net result&mdash;a greatcoat
kicking about in a passage till it is lost or appropriated.
Your deal, partner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is merely a matter of taking a little trouble,&quot;
said Mr. Brett precisely. &quot;Once boys have been
taught to grasp the fact that rules are made to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
obeyed and not ignored, the thing is simple. My
House&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Partner, I leave it to you,&quot; said Mr. Allnutt,
<i>fortissimo</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No trumps!&quot; said Mr. Haydock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As a matter of fact, Brett,&quot; observed the Head,
as the dummy was laid down,&mdash;he was a genial
despot, and Mr. Brett's pedantic fussiness was a
perpetual thorn in his flesh,&mdash;&quot;the boys I saw on
Saturday were yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Allnutt laughed loudly, and Mr. Brett,
greatly put out, omitted to return the Head's lead,
with the result that his opponents made four odd
tricks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Game!&quot; announced Mr. Allnutt, quite superfluously.
&quot;Thank you, partner. Pretty work!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a pity you did not return my diamond,
Brett,&quot; remarked the Head mildly. He was counted
one of the great Headmasters of his time, but he
was as human as the rest of us where lost tricks
were concerned. &quot;I had the game in my hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Brett stiffly expressed regret, and continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you mind giving me the names of the
boys you saw? I simply can't understand it. I
think there must be some mistake. No boy in my
House&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As a matter of fact,&quot; said Haydock,&mdash;he was
the acknowledged peacemaker and mediator of the
Staff,&mdash;&quot;it is very difficult to get boys to wear
their greatcoats. I can't help sympathising with
them. They usually don't require them at all, for
they run straight up to their game and straight
down again. But when, as sometimes happens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
they find an exciting match going on on Big Side,
they can't resist the temptation of waiting for a
minute or two&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Allnutt interrupted. Listening to other people
was not a foible of his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense!&quot; he said with great gusto, as the
Head began to deal the next hand. &quot;You can't
tether healthy boys with red tape. Always disregard
red tape&mdash;that's my motto!&quot; (By red tape
Mr. Allnutt meant instructions from headquarters
which did not happen to meet with his approval.)
&quot;Now, <i>my</i> boys&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spades!&quot; said the Head, gloomily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I play to a spade, partner?&quot; asked Mr.
Haydock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, so far as I am concerned,&quot; said Mr.
Allnutt. &quot;Glad to be out of it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Brett, whose hand contained four aces,
flung his cards upon the table and glared at his
superior.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very sorry, Brett,&quot; said the Head, &quot;but it had
to be done. I had nothing above a nine in my hand.
I was afraid they would double anything you declared.
My cut, I think, Haydock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the next ten minutes, fortunately, Mr. Brett
was too much chagrined to speak, and the topic of
the overcoats was allowed to drop.</p>

<p class="indent">The game continued for another few rounds, with
the luck fairly evenly divided and the scoring low.
Presently the Head, who usually contrived to
achieve a good deal of quiet legislation during these
social evenings, remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall have to create three new School monitors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
at the end of the term.  Have you any candidates,
Allnutt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can select any boy in my House you like,&quot;
replied Allnutt.  He was habitually truculent to
those set in authority over him,&mdash;he regarded
them as a humanised form of red tape,&mdash;but the
shrewd Head, who knew that Allnutt was a good
man at bottom, suffered him with humourous resignation.
&quot;They are all equally incompetent. Luckily
I am in the habit of looking after my House
myself, and not leaving it to half-baked policemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the Head.  &quot;That leaves me
with a comfortably free hand.  Have you any one
to recommend, Brett?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Brett.  &quot;I have.  I have considered
the matter most carefully.  I have at least four
boys who would make admirable monitors&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Game all!&quot; said Mr. Allnutt impatiently.
&quot;Your deal, Brett.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&mdash;&quot;And I have decided,&quot; continued Mr. Brett,
bending his brows judicially, &quot;to recommend
Ericson and Smythe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nincompoops, both of them,&quot; observed Mr.
Allnutt at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fancy Brett was addressing the Headmaster,&quot;
said Haydock drily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, this is quite an informal discussion,&quot; said
Mr. Allnutt cheerfully.  &quot;The best boys in your
House, Brett, are Meldrum and Lemaire.  Why
don't you recommend them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a great effort Mr. Brett kept his temper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They do not happen to be House prefects,&quot; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
replied stiffly, &quot;and are therefore ineligible for
monitorships.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Much to Mr. Brett's discomfiture, all three of his
companions turned and gazed at him in undisguised
astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, man,&quot; burst out Mr. Allnutt, &quot;Lemaire
is the most brilliant boy in the School!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His bodily infirmity&quot;&mdash;began Mr. Brett
majestically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see, I see,&quot; said Allnutt. &quot;Bodily infirmity is
a bar to promotion in your House; but not mental
infirmity&mdash;eh? I suppose you have noticed that
Ericson is a congenital idiot?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Brett, pursing his lips, began to deal the
cards with great stateliness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what about Meldrum?&quot; continued Mr.
Allnutt, following up his attack. &quot;He has more
character than all the rest of your House put together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; replied Mr. Brett icily, &quot;he
has no brains.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here Mr. Brett made a serious blunder. He
offended the only man in the room who might have
felt inclined to protect him from the bludgeonings
of Mr. Allnutt. Mr. Haydock happened to be
senior mathematical master at Studley, and like
all broad-minded men hated anything like intellectual
snobbery.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meldrum,&quot; he remarked, &quot;is the soundest
mathematician in the School, and quite the most
brilliant scientist we have had for ten years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Possibly, possibly,&quot; said Mr. Brett; &quot;but that
does not affect my point. No trumps!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
Mr. Haydock flushed red at this gratuitous piece
of offensiveness.  But he said nothing, and took up
his cards.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I play to no trumps, partner?&quot; enquired
Mr. Allnutt.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haydock glanced over his hand, and sighed
to himself, softly and gratefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall double no trumps,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Brett grew greatly excited.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall redouble!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I,&quot; replied Mr. Haydock gently, &quot;shall
double again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Head, upon whom the asperities of the last
ten minutes (since he might not take part therein
himself) had begun to pall, sat up, startled, and the
game began&mdash;at ninety-six points a trick.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Brett's hand contained eight spades, to the
ten, knave, queen, king; the aces of clubs, hearts,
and diamonds; and two small clubs. It was a tempting
but treacherous hand, for singleton aces are but
broken reeds.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haydock had nine hearts to the knave,
queen, king; the ace of spades; and the king of
clubs, singly guarded.  His hope of salvation was
founded on the sure and certain knowledge that Mr.
Allnutt would lead him a heart, for they conformed
to the heart convention.  Assuming that Mr. Brett
held the ace, the hearts could be established in a
single round.  After this he looked to his ace of
spades or king of clubs to regain the lead for him.
Of course if Brett held an overwhelming hand of
diamonds the game was lost.  There was also the
possibility that Allnutt had no heart to lead.  But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
there seemed to be a good sporting chance of success.</p>

<p class="indent">And sure enough the Fates&mdash;very justly, considering
his recent behaviour to Mr. Haydock&mdash;fought
against Mr. Brett.  Mr. Allnutt led a small
heart; the Head, with a rueful smile, laid down a
hand containing two knaves and a ten; Mr. Haydock
played the king; and Mr. Brett, having
nothing else, took the trick with the ace.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Mr. Brett, scrutinising his hand and putting
two and two together, broke into a gentle perspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">The ace of spades&mdash;the one card necessary to
give him every trick but two&mdash;was in the hands
of the enemy.  Still, eight spades to the ten, knave,
queen, king, mean seven tricks once you have
forced the ace out.  Hoping blindly for the best,
and pretending not to hear the contented rumblings
of Mr. Allnutt, the wretched Mr. Brett
played the ten of spades.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haydock promptly took the trick with the
ace, and then proceeded to make eight tricks in
hearts.  After this he graciously permitted Mr. Brett
to make his other two aces and remaining spade.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Three tricks,&quot; said Mr. Haydock. &quot;Game and
rubber.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hard luck, partner,&quot; murmured the Head
heroically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What exactly,&quot; enquired Mr. Allnutt, brimming
over with happy laughter, &quot;does three times
ninety-six come to?  Two hundred and eighty-eight?
Thanks.  What a lightning calculator you are, Haydock.
A mathematician has his points&mdash;eh, Brett?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span></p>

<p class="h3">V</p>

<p class="indent">It was nearly ten o'clock. Most of the boys were
in their dormitories by this time, either in bed or
cultivating the rites of Mr. Sandow. Only the
seniors lingered downstairs. Various young gentlemen
who shortly meditated a descent upon one of
the Universities sat in their studies with curtains
closely drawn, painfully translating a Greek not
spoken in Greece into an English not spoken anywhere.
The Quartette were all together in Philip's
study, engaged in one of the commonest recreations
of English gentlemen.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Desborough uncoiled his long legs
from under the table, and stretched himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fairly average frowst in here,&quot; he observed.
&quot;Anybody mind if I open the window?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silence gave consent. The curtains slid back,
and some much-needed oxygen was admitted. A
long ray of light shot out into the darkness of the
night.</p>

<p class="indent">It fell across the path of Mr. Brett, returning
from his bridge party. The evening breezes played
about his brow, but failed to cool it. He was in a
towering rage. His management of his own House;
his powers of selecting suitable lieutenants; these
things had been called into question that night&mdash;called
into question and condemned. And&mdash;he
had lost five-and-sixpence to Allnutt.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly his homeward way was illumined by
electric light. It came from the window of Philip
Meldrum's study, which was situated upon the
ground floor. Mr. Brett paused, drew near, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
surveyed the scene within. In the confined space of
the study he beheld four boys sitting closely round
a table.</p>

<p class="indent">A minute later he was fumbling for his latchkey
at his own front door. He was in a frenzy of excitement.
He did not pause to reflect. Humour was
not his strong point, or it might possibly have
occurred to him that the present situation possessed
a certain piquancy of its own. Had Mr. Allnutt
been present he would have made an apposite
reference to the Old Obadiah and the Young Obadiah.
All that Mr. Brett realised was the fact that
Providence had most unexpectedly put into his
hand the means of vindicating his own infallibility
as a judge of boy character, and&mdash;of scoring off
Allnutt for all time.</p>

<p class="indent">With eager steps he passed through his own quarters,
and hurried down the long panelled corridor
in which the boys' studies were situated. He opened
Philip's door quickly, without knocking, and stood
glaring balefully through his spectacles upon the
culprits.</p>

<p class="indent">Their heads were sunk upon their chests, but
not with shame. In fact they entirely failed to
observe Mr. Brett's avenging presence.</p>

<p class="indent">The first person to speak was Philip, who was
sitting with his back to the door. He threw his
cards down upon the table and said cheerfully:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well done, partner! Three tricks, doubled&mdash;that's
seventy-two. Game and rubber, and you
owe me fourpence, young Laird of Cockpen! Now,
what about bed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span></p>

<p class="h3">VI</p>

<p class="indent">No one was expelled, though in the first frenzy
of his triumph Mr. Brett was for telephoning for
four cabs on the spot.</p>

<p class="indent">The Head gave judgment in due course, and
though he had no particular difficulty in dealing
with the criminals, he experienced some trouble in
handling the counsel for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="indent">To him the overheated Brett pointed out that
the delinquents had been caught redhanded in the
sin of betting and gambling. He explained that
smoking, drinking, and cards invariably went
together, and that consequently nothing remained
but to request the respective parents and guardians
of the Quartette to remove them with all
possible despatch before they contaminated any
of the Classics or Cricketers in the House.</p>

<p class="indent">The Head heard him out, and remarked drily:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Brett, you should cultivate a sense of proportion.
It is a useful quality in a schoolmaster.
Your scheme of retribution, if I may say so, is a
little lacking in elasticity. There are degrees of
crime, you know. Under your penal code the man
who has been caught playing pitch-and-toss is
hurried to the gallows with the same celerity as the
man who has garotted an Archbishop. Don't you
think that this scheme of yours of uniform penalty
for everything rather encourages the criminal to go
the whole hog and have his money's worth? Now
observe: the offence of these boys was a purely
technical one. A game of cards between gentlemen
for stakes which they can reasonably afford&quot;&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
Quartette played for twopence a hundred&mdash;&quot;is
not in itself an indictable offence. I only wish
that boys would always employ their spare time so
profitably!&quot; added the Head regretfully. &quot;Personally,
I should sincerely like to see every boy in
this School grounded systematically in the elements
of whist or bridge. It would improve his
memory and inculcate habits of observation and
deduction, and would at least furnish him with an
alternative to the cinematograph on a wet afternoon
in the holidays. Unfortunately we have the
British parent to deal with. However, that is a
digression. These boys are not of the stuff that
debauchees are made of. The trouble lies in the fact
that they are rather more mature than their fellows.
Do you know, I expect they play bridge because
they like it, and find it a more pleasant relaxation
at the end of the day than cooking unholy
messes over their study fires or gossiping in the dormitory?
I must also point out to you that by not
appointing them to a position of authority you
have thrown them more or less on their own resources.
They may not associate with the aristocracy
of the House, and they are more than a cut
above the common herd. So they form themselves
into a very snug and exclusive little coterie, and I
for one don't blame them. But send them along to
me, and I will deal faithfully with them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To the Quartette the Head pointed out that
there is a time and place for everything, and that
rules, if not enforced, bring mockery and discredit
upon their authors.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bridge is an excellent game,&quot; he said, &quot;and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
true mental gymnastic. But there happens to be a
regulation here which forbids the playing of cards
by boys among themselves. We need not go into
the soundness of that regulation: the only relevant
point is that you have broken it. You are big boys,
and the bigger the boy the bigger the offence. I
am going to make the punishment fit the crime by
asking Mr. Brett to turn you out of your studies
for the rest of the term. For the next four weeks
you will consort with the <i>profanum vulgus</i> in your
House Common Room, where I fancy that bridge
and other intellectual pursuits are not much cultivated.
Now you can go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Quartette turned dismally towards the
door. It was a stiff sentence. But the Head had not
quite finished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be interesting,&quot; he added drily, &quot;to
know whether you play bridge because you like it
or because you think it a grand thing to do. Come
and dine with me on Saturday night, and we will
have a rubber.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sportsman, the old Head!&quot; commented Philip,
as they walked across the quadrangle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My word, yes!&quot; said the other three.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<p class="h3">THE IRON AGE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Mablethorpe</span> was much interested when
Philip told him the story in the holidays.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Head is all right,&quot; he said. &quot;He was only a
housemaster in my day, but there was no doubting
his quality, even then. But this man Brett is a
national disaster. Do you think you can derive
any further profit from remaining his disciple?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No, Philip thought not.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">So Philip arrived at Coventry at last, having
started some years previously, it may be remembered.</p>

<p class="indent">He was enrolled as a premium apprentice at the
great works of the Britannia Motor Company.
Here he learned to use his fingers and his fists, his
muscles and his wits. He passed through the
drawing-office, and the erecting-shop, and the
repairing-shop. The last interested him most of
all, for the Britannia Company repaired other cars
besides their own; so here Philip could indulge in
the pleasures of variety. He learned to handle cars
of every grade and breed. There was the lordly
Britannia car itself&mdash;the final word in automobilism&mdash;with
its long gleaming body and six-cylinder
engine, so silent and free from vibration that it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
possible to balance a half-crown edgewise upon the
faintly humming radiator. There were countless
other makes&mdash;racing-cars, runabout cars, commercial
cars, even motor omnibuses. Philip learned
to know the inner economy and peculiar ailments
of all. There were American cars so cheap that you
could not believe it possible that they could be sold
at a profit to the maker&mdash;until it became necessary
to put in repairs or adjustments. Then the whole
car seemed to fall to pieces like a house of cards.
Exasperated mechanics in the Britannia repairing-shop
had a saying that if you wanted to take up the
engine-bearings in one of these cars you had to
begin by taking down the back axle. There was
sufficient truth in this adage to set Philip wondering
why such a nation of born engineers should make a
point of placing their nuts and bolts in almost inaccessible
positions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the reason of it all?&quot; he enquired one
day of a colleague from Pittsburg, who was assisting
him to dismantle the greater part of the clutch
and flywheel of a cheap American car as a preliminary
to adjusting the magneto. &quot;Why do you
make cars like jig-saw puzzles?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The colleague explained. He was a pleasant
youth of twenty, with the studiously courteous
manners of the American gentleman,&mdash;they contrasted
quaintly with Philip's shy native <i>brusquerie</i>,&mdash;sent
by a big-headed father to acquire a little
British ballast before assuming the position of
second in command at home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I conclude it is because our national point of
view is different from yours,&quot; he said. &quot;These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
cars aren't <i>meant</i> to be repaired. We make it as
difficult as possible to do so. You in this country
like to build a car that will last&mdash;like Westminster
Abbey. Over there we say: 'What is the use of
sinking good money in a design that will be out of
date in two years anyway? Make it good if you
can, but make it cheap, and when it wears out,
make another. And whatever you do, don't fool
around tinkering. Life's too short.' At least it is in
our country,&quot; he added, smiling. &quot;Over here you
seem to make it go a bit further, like your automobiles.
Unscrew that nut some more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were full and profitable years, those at the
Britannia Works. As Philip gradually emancipated
himself from the hard manual labour of the shops
and rose from practical to theoretical problems, his
old mathematical and scientific ability cropped out
again. His inventive genius began to stir. Petrol
was going steadily up in price, so Philip set himself
to experiment with substitutes. The result was the
Meldrum Paraffin Carburettor, now a standard
adjunct of the commercial motor. Later on came
the Meldrum Fool-proof Automatic Lubricator,
which achieved high favour with absent-minded
amateurs who made a hobby of allowing their
engines to seize. And later, in fulness of time, came
the Meldrum Automatic Electro-magnetic Brake,
which was destined to play a tremendous part in
Philip's history, as you shall hear.</p>

<p class="indent">With all these burning interests to occupy him,
Philip had little time for amusement. He played
Rugby Football regularly for Coventry City; and
any one who has had experience of that gentle pastime
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
as cultivated in the Midland counties will
realise the testimonial to Philip's muscle and general
fitness involved in his selection. Every Saturday
he fared forth with his colleagues to do battle
with the men of Moseley and Leicester, or even
penetrated to London, there to indulge in feats of
personal but friendly violence at the expense of
Blackheath or the London Scottish. He particularly
enjoyed the occasional visits of the team to
Oxford and Cambridge, for there he usually encountered
some old friend&mdash;Lemaire, now a
scholar of Balliol, or Desborough, coaching a crew
upon the tortuous Cam.</p>

<p class="indent">But Rugby football was no fetish with Philip&mdash;which
would have pleased Mr. Brett. All his heart
was centred on his work. To Philip in those days
Work was Life&mdash;a point of view which in due
course Time would correct, or rather supplement.
Each night when he said his prayers,&mdash;he had
contracted the habit at the age of sixteen, after a
certain Sunday evening sermon from the Head,
backed by a particular hymn, which had awakened
in his rapidly developing little soul the knowledge
that there were more things in heaven and earth
than were included in Uncle Joseph's scheme of
education,&mdash;he asked his Maker, <i>tout court</i>, for
work, and work, and more work, and health wherewith
to perform it. Only that.</p>

<p class="indent">In addition to Collier, the American, he made
other friends about the Works. Some were of
humble station; others&mdash;like himself&mdash;premium
apprentices who had paid to be taught their business,
and hoped one day to direct businesses of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
own, or at the worst lounge immaculately in a showroom
in Bond Street or Pall Mall, intimidating
wealthy but plebeian patrons into buying more
expensive cars than had been their original intention.
They were a rowdy, sociable, good-hearted
crew, addicted to what they called &quot;jags&quot; on Saturday
nights. Then there were the salaried staff
of the Works. One, Bilston, director of the drawing-office,
conceived a strong liking for the capable
Meldrum, and it was mainly through his representations
that Philip, when he emerged from his
apprenticeship and began to pass examinations,
was kept on at the Works and given a post which
combined increased responsibility with further
opportunities to perfect himself in his craft.</p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally Philip took a holiday. Sometimes
he went to Cheltenham, where Uncle Joseph, roaring
like any sucking dove, was devoting his reclaimed
existence to Territorial Associations and
Boy Scouts. To be quite frank, Philip was secretly
conscious of a feeling of slight boredom at Cheltenham.
A perfectly happy couple are undeniably
just a little dull, and Uncle Joseph and the Beautiful
Lady were so entirely wrapped up in one another
and their daughter&mdash;an infant of quite phenomenal
wisdom and beauty&mdash;that the ordinary
pleasures of life were not for them. They held,
rightly, that pleasure is the resource of those who
have failed to find happiness, and consequently
had no need of it; but their nephew, who had not
yet arrived at the period when a man begins to ask
himself whether he is happy or not, and possessed a
frank and healthy appetite for the usual diversions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
of a young man on holiday, found existence at
Cheltenham a trifle too idyllic to be satisfying.</p>

<p class="indent">He enjoyed himself more at Red Gables. Mr.
Mablethorpe remained as incorrigibly Peter Pannish
as ever. Although his hair was whitening and
his figure becoming more spherical, he declined to
grow up. His levity was a perpetual sorrow to his
sensitive spouse. Once, in response to a more than
usually tearful appeal, he made a resolute effort to
reform. He read the &quot;Times&quot; at breakfast, supplements
and all. He dressed himself in tight garments
and accompanied his wife to tea-parties. He
began to talk of engaging a chauffeur instead of
indulging in personal bear-fights with Boanerges.
In short, he became so unspeakably dull that Mrs.
Mablethorpe grew more tearful than ever, and said
it was breaking her spirit to have to keep on smiling
and being cheerful for two. Whereupon Mr.
Mablethorpe, removing his tongue from his cheek,
reverted to his former state, to the great comfort of
Red Gables.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the Dumpling, Philip did not see much. She
was usually at school; but when they met during
the holidays she always appeared to her former
playmate to have lost yet more of her adiposity
and to have shot up another six inches. But they
continued to be firm allies; and though in time the
dumpling grew reserved and <i>gauche</i>, after the manner
of adolescent maidens, their old joyous <i>camaraderie</i>
over such things as Boanerges and birds' nests was
never suffered to die out.</p>

<p class="indent">One other haunt of his youth Philip visited&mdash;the
house on Hampstead Heath.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
He went twice. The first visit was paid during
one of his school holidays, a trial trip on a new
bicycle affording a pretext. (Philip was too much
of a schoolboy by this time to admit even to himself
that he proposed to ride forty miles just to see a
girl.) It was midsummer. He arrived on the Heath
about two in the afternoon, and, leaving his bicycle
leaning against the trysting-gate of happy memory,
cruised methodically about, stealthily watching the
house in the hope that a certain slim figure would
emerge from the side door and come skipping down
the road.</p>

<p class="indent">But no such thing happened. The only member
of the household whom he encountered was Montagu
Falconer himself. He swung suddenly out
of a side road, walking at his usual frantic pace,
and, looking straight through Philip, whom he entirely
failed to recognise, shot past him and was
gone. But nothing further happened, and our
knight, after lingering until dusk, pedalled home
unrewarded by a glimpse of his Lady.</p>

<p class="indent">The second visit was paid two years later. This
time Philip arrived at Hampstead by Tube, and
walked boldly up to the Heath, big with resolution.
He had decided to ring the bell like a real afternoon
caller and enquire if Mrs. Falconer were at
home.</p>

<p class="indent">As he drew near the house his footsteps faltered.
Young women may wonder why, but the young man
who still remembers the agony of his first formal
call will not. But Philip walked on resolutely.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally he arrived at the house of his Lady. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
was shuttered and silent. The garden was weedy
and the lawn unshaven. Beside the gate a staring
board said:&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV</h2>

<p class="h3">OMEGA, CERTAINLY NOT!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Miss Sylvia Mablethorpe</span>&mdash;&quot;also known to
the police,&quot; to quote her unfeeling papa, as Dumpling,
Dumps, Daniel Lambert, and the Tichborne
Claimant&mdash;sat upon the high wall which
enclosed the demesne of Red Gables, gazing comfortably
up and down the long white road. In her
lap lay cherries, in her hand a novel. It was a hot
summer afternoon. She had exchanged greetings
with the local policeman, various school-children,
and the curate, all of whom had passed by upon
their several errands within the last half-hour. For
the moment the road was clear, and Dumps had
leisure to resume the pursuit of literature.</p>

<p class="indent">But she had barely covered half a page when
there fell upon her ears the sound of a horse's
hoofs. Dumps, however, did not raise her eyes
from the not very interesting volume before her,
though it may be noted that she had looked up
readily enough upon the advent of the curate, the
policeman, and the school-children. All of which
was a sign that Dumps was growing up. Indeed,
she had left school a month ago, and was to go
abroad in a few weeks to undergo that mysterious
feminine process known as &quot;finishing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The clatter of hoofs grew louder, slowed down,
and came to a stealthy stop just opposite to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
part of the wall whereon Dumps was seated. She
looked up lazily, to find a pleasantly sunburned
youth of twenty-two removing his cap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, Derek!&quot; she observed casually. &quot;That
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Master Derek blushed guiltily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;Good-afternoon. I only got
back from Aldershot last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh. Have you been away?&quot; enquired the
heartless Dumps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Four months,&quot; replied Derek, in tones of respectful
reproach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now you are home for the holidays?&quot;
remarked Miss Mablethorpe brightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Long leave,&quot; Derek corrected her, in a humble
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What fun it must be,&quot; continued Sylvia, &quot;living
in a tent for weeks and doing nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Second Lieutenant Rayner, who had just spent
four strenuous months under canvas or on man&oelig;uvres,
ending with a route march in which his battalion
had covered a hundred and twenty miles in
four days, smiled wanly. No man is a hero to the
girl with whom he has played in infancy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Topping weather, isn't it?&quot; he observed presently.</p>

<p class="indent">Dumps agreed, sunning herself luxuriously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does your mare eat cherries?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but I do,&quot; said Derek with great boldness.</p>

<p class="indent">Dumps threw him down a couple, and continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am waiting for Dad. He is correcting proofs&mdash;very
cross. When he has finished we are going
out in Boanerges.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
&quot;Have you still got Boanerges?&quot; asked Derek
incredulously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but he is on his very last legs. We have a
new car coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What sort?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A Britannia. It has been specially selected
for us,&quot; said Dumps with pride, &quot;by&mdash;by an official
of the company. The front seat is being put a
little forward, so that I can drive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A few years ago Master Derek Rayner would
have greeted this announcement with some exceedingly
witty and caustic comments. Now he merely
murmured reverentially:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect you will make a ripping little chauffeur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shouldn't wonder,&quot; agreed Dumps complacently.
&quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, just for a ride,&quot; said Derek. &quot;Are your
people quite well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell Mrs. Mablethorpe I was asking for her,
will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will make a point of it,&quot; said the impervious
Dumps. Then, relenting slightly, she enquired:
&quot;Are you going to tennis at Oatlands on Thursday?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Derek eagerly. &quot;Would you mind
being my partner in the mixed doubles?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that a sudden inspiration?&quot; asked Dumps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, really. I have been meaning to ask you for
weeks. That's why I rode over here this afternoon,&quot;
blurted out Derek.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you said you were just out for a ride,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
remarked Miss Mablethorpe. (It is quite a mistake
to suppose that it is only small boys who are cruel
to the humbler members of creation.)</p>

<p class="indent">Derek floundered helplessly, and was dumb.
From afar came the melodious toot of a well-modulated
Gabriel horn. Dumps sat up, and looked
sharply up the road.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, anyway, will you be my partner?&quot; asked
Derek, lifting his eyes once more. He was surprised
and not a little gratified to observe that Miss
Sylvia had turned excessively pink.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;perhaps. No. All right,&quot; replied the
girl shortly. &quot;I must go now. Good-bye. See you
on Thursday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By way of intimating that the audience was
terminated, Miss Mablethorpe swung her ankles&mdash;they
had grown quite slim these days&mdash;over
the wall and disappeared with a thud. Mr. Rayner,
on the whole much puffed up, galloped away.</p>

<p class="indent">Two minutes later an automobile, consisting
chiefly of a chassis, with a single wooden seat lashed
to the frame, slid to a standstill outside the gates of
Red Gables. On the back of the seat, in bold letters,
was painted the legend, &quot;Britannia Motor Company,
Coventry.&quot; In the seat sat Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">The car had hardly stopped when the gates were
swung open and Dumps appeared, smiling welcome.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Philip!&quot; she said. &quot;Is this our new car?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not quite,&quot; said Philip, surveying his dingy but
workmanlike equipage. &quot;This is my service-car.
They are sending yours on Monday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time the girl had clambered on to the
back of the chassis and ensconced herself on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
petrol-tank. Philip, turning the car in through the
gates, drove up the short straight avenue to the
front door. The purring of the big engine ceased,
and the pair, having alighted, passed arm-in-arm,
like brother and sister, into the presence of Mr.
Mablethorpe.</p>

<p class="indent">That excellent but volcanic author was discovered
tearing his hair with one hand, and digging
holes in a long galley proof (employing a fountain-pen
as a stiletto) with the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Philip!&quot; he began at once. &quot;Will you
have a bet with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Philip. &quot;What about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I bet you one million pounds,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe
with great precision, &quot;that the condemned
printing-firm employed by my unmentionable publishers
has taken into its adjectival employment an
asterisked staff of obelised female compositors.
Consequently I shall have to retire to an asylum.
It is a nuisance, because I have just bought a new
automobile.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are you so certain about the female compositors?&quot;
asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">The author pathetically flapped the long printed
slip in his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't mind correcting misprints,&quot; he said.
&quot;I am used to it. Male compositors cannot spell, of
course; in fact, very few of them can read. But
they do understand stops; at least, they put in the
stops that an author gives them. The female of the
species, on the other hand, only recognises the
existence of two&mdash;the comma and the note of
exclamation. These she drops into the script as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
would drop cloves into an apple-tart&mdash;a handful
or two when she has finished setting up the type.
At least, I suppose so. She also sets her face against
the senseless custom of using capital letters to begin
a sentence. Otherwise she is admirably suited
to her calling. Look at this!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He exhibited a corrected proof&mdash;a mass of red
ink and marginal profanity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am feeling better now,&quot; he said. &quot;I have
written both to the publisher and printer. The
letter to the printer was particularly good. Have a
cigarette? What have you come to see us for&mdash;business
or pleasure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Business,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Public or private?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip considered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Private.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe turned to his daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Inquisitive female,&quot; he thundered, &quot;avaunt!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it's not private to Dumps,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I
have been offered a new billet, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then let us all sit down and argue about it,&quot;
proposed Mr. Mablethorpe with zest. He threw
his proofs on the floor. &quot;My wife is upstairs, reading
the mendacious prospectus of a new Continental
spa, and I don't suppose she will develop the
symptoms it professes to cure much before six
o'clock. Go ahead, Philip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The directors want me to take charge of the
London offices,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are the London offices, where are they,
and why do they require taking charge of?&quot; enquired
Mr. Mablethorpe categorically. Like all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
unmethodical and scatter-brained persons he
cherished a high opinion of himself as a man of
affairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The London offices,&quot; said Philip, &quot;are in Oxford
Street. They consist of a show-room, full of
new cars&mdash;the Company gets most of its orders
through this show-room&mdash;and a biggish garage
and repairing-shop at the back, opening into somewhere
in Soho.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And do they want you to tell untruths in the
show-room or wash cars in the garage?&quot; enquired
Mr. Mablethorpe.</p>

<p class="indent">Dumps stiffened indignantly, but Philip
laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They want me to boss the whole place,&quot; he
said. &quot;Hitherto they have had a man in charge of
the show-room and another in charge of the garage,
and there has been everlasting trouble between
them. I gather that the show-room man is young&mdash;an
old public-school boy&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know! Wears white spats, and sends for an
underling to open the bonnet of a car when a customer
asks to see the works,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe.
&quot;Go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the repair-shop man is elderly and Yorkshire
and a ranker. I fancy they parted brass-rags
from the start, with the result that working expenses
are too high&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surprising!&quot; murmured Mr. Mablethorpe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;And I have been told off to go to town and
supervise the pair of them,&quot; concluded Philip.
&quot;Shall I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
&quot;Well&mdash;I shall be giving up my other work, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is your other work? Describe one of your
ordinary days in detail.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip did so. When he had finished, Mr. Mablethorpe
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if that is the sort of life your tastes incline
to, why not go the whole hog and get ten years'
penal servitude right away? That strikes me as an
equally suitable and much more economical method
of satisfying your desires. Consider! You would
get ten years of continuous employment, of a kind
almost identical with your present occupation, and
the State&mdash;people like me&mdash;would maintain you
into the bargain. No rates, no taxes, no extortionate
tradesmen, no women of any kind! Regular
hours, rational diet, and free spiritual consolation!
What more could a man ask? True, your hours of
work would be shorter than at present, but I dare
say that if you were good they would allow you an
extra go at the oakum when no one else was using
it. That's the plan, Philip! Put the thing on a
business footing at once, and get arrested! Don't
overdo it, of course. It is no use committing a crime
they could hang you for: that would be <i>trop de zèle</i>.
Supposing you burn down the Houses of Parliament&mdash;or,
better still, the Imperial Institute&mdash;or
get to work on some of your personal friends with a
chopper, and carve ten years' worth out of them.
Start on Dumps here. She would make a capital
subject for experiment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Mablethorpe turned to the visitor with an
apologetic smile.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
&quot;He will be all right presently,&quot; she said, indicating
her parent. &quot;He is always a little strange in his
manner after correcting proofs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was right. Presently Mr. Mablethorpe, who
had been ranting about the room, to the detriment
of waste-paper baskets and revolving bookcases,
sat down and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are reluctant to give up your present
berth, Phil?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip, &quot;I am. You see,&quot; he added
a little shyly, &quot;it's my work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so,&quot; agreed Mr. Mablethorpe, suddenly
serious. &quot;You believe that work is the key of life.
<i>Labor omnia vincit</i>&mdash;eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip nodded, but Dumps enquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does that mean, please?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her father translated, and continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philip, let me tell you something. You are in
danger of becoming a specialist. Life, roughly, is
made up of two ingredients&mdash;Things and People.
At present you are devoting yourself entirely to
Things&mdash;to Work, in fact. How many years have
you lived in Coventry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About five.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very good. And how many people do you know
there? I am not referring to your fellow stokers.
I mean people outside the place. How many?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip pondered, and shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Half a dozen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There you are, right away!&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe,
with the intensely satisfied air of one who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
has scored a point. &quot;You have spent five years in a
place, and barely know half a dozen people there.
You are becoming a specialist, my son&mdash;a specialist
in Things. That is all wrong. You are lop-sided.
Man was never intended to devote himself to
Things, to the exclusion of People&mdash;least of all
you, with your strong gregarious instincts and
human sympathies. Isn't that true?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip considered. Long dormant visions were
awakening within him. His thoughts went back to
the days when he had decided to follow the calling
of a knight-errant. That decision had not occupied
his attention much of late, he reflected.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And therefore,&quot; continued Mr. Mablethorpe,
&quot;I counsel you to go to London and take up the new
billet. Go and reason with the Yorkshire foreman,
and pulverize the gentleman in spats, and argue
with creditors&mdash;go and study <i>People</i>. Study the
way they walk, the way they talk, the way they
think, the way they drink. You won't like them.
They will shirk their work, or blow in your face, or
tell you anecdotes which will make you weep. But
they will restore your balance. They will develop
the human side of you. Then you will be really
rather an exceptional character, Philip. Very few
of us are evenly balanced between Things and People.
All women, for instance, have a permanent
list toward People. Things have no meaning for
them. A triumph of engineering, or organisation, or
art, or logical reasoning, makes no appeal whatever
to a woman's enthusiasm. She may admire the man
who achieves them, of course, but only because he
happens to have sad eyes, or a firm mouth, or a wife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
in an asylum. If the personal touch be lacking,
Things simply bore Woman. I once showed an
aunt of mine&mdash;a refined and intelligent woman&mdash;round
the finest cathedral in England, and the one
solitary feature of the whole fabric which interested
her was a certain stall in the choir, where a grandnephew
of hers had once sat for eighteen months as
a choir-boy! Yes, women are undoubtedly lopsided.
Men, as a whole, are predisposed the other
way&mdash;which largely accounts for what is known
as sex-antagonism. Heaven help all novelists if no
such thing existed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shop!&quot; remarked the unfilial Dumps.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe, recalled to his text, continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, then. We agree that Things&mdash;by
which we mean Work&mdash;are not the Alpha and
Omega of Life. Alpha, perhaps; Omega, certainly
not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you mean, 'Archibald, Certainly Not!'
Daddy?&quot; enquired Miss Dumps, referring to a
popular ditty of the moment. Mr. Mablethorpe
took no heed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Labor omnia vincit</i>,&quot; he said, &quot;is only half a
truth. There is another maxim in the same tongue
which supplies the other half. You can easily commit
it to memory if you bear in mind the fact that
it ends a pentameter, while the other ends a hexameter.
It is: <i>Omnia vincit amor</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He translated for the benefit of his unlearned
daughter, and swept on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, consider. If it is true that Work conquers
All, and equally true that Love conquers All, what
must be our logical and inevitable conclusion?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
It was Dumps who answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That Love and Work come to the same thing in
the end,&quot; she said. Her eyes met Philip's, and
dropped quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe nodded his head gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philip,&quot; he said, &quot;you hear the words of this
wise infant? They are true. That is why I want
you to go and mix with People. You are getting a
bit too mechanical in your conception of Life. You
are in danger of becoming an automaton. You must
cultivate your emotions a bit&mdash;Love, Hate, Pity,
Joy, Sorrow&mdash;if you want to turn into a perfectly
equipped Man. Taking them all round, it is impossible
to get to know one's fellow creatures without
getting to love them. That is the secret which
has kept this old world plodding along so philosophically
for so many centuries. So start in on
People, my son. Go to London and take up that
appointment. You will regret your old workshop
at times. Machinery is never illogical, or unreasonable,
or ungrateful; and though it may break your
arms and legs, it will never try to break your heart.
Still, it is only machinery. If you want to attain
to the supreme joys of Life you will have to be prepared
for the deep sorrows too, and you can only
meet with these things by consorting with human
beings. You have discovered for yourself&mdash;or
think you have&mdash;that <i>labor omnia vincit</i>. Go on
now until you realise the meaning of the other
phrase of which I spoke. When that happens you
will have found yourself. You will be poised and
balanced. In short, my son, you will be a Man.
Now let us scramble for muffins.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI</h2>

<p class="h3">THINGS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Euston Road, which is perhaps the most
funereal thoroughfare in Europe, furnishes their
first glimpse of London to fully fifty per cent of all
who visit our capital.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip was no stranger to London, for he had
spent his youth in the wilds of Hampstead; and
later on, like most young men, had formed a tolerably
intimate acquaintance with that portion of
the metropolis which lies within a radius of one
mile of Piccadilly Circus. Still, as his cab hurried
away from the unspeakable hideousness of Euston
Station and turned into that congeries of tombstone-makers'
yards and unsavoury lodging-houses
which constitutes the Euston Road, even Coventry
seemed pleasantly rural by comparison. Most of us
are inclined to feel like this at the outset of a new
undertaking. Fortunately we can support ourselves
through this period with the reflection that
every success worth winning is approached by a
Euston Road of some kind.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip's first few weeks in the London offices were
a prolongation of this journey. The young gentleman
in the show-room proved to be unspeakably
offensive and incompetent; the Yorkshireman in
the repairing-shop was incredibly obstinate and
secretive. The staff were slack, and the premises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
dirty. Letters were not answered promptly, and
the accounts were in a shocking mess. Finally,
every soul in the place (with the possible exception
of the lady typist) greeted the intrusion of the new
manager with undisguised hostility.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, reminding himself of the period of time in
which Rome was not built, set to work, in his serious
methodical fashion, to master departmental
details. He went through the repair-shop first, and
mindful of Mr. Mablethorpe's admonition to observe
People rather than Things, spent much time
in studying the characters of each of the men employed.
As a result of his investigations two mechanics,
props of their Union, were tersely informed
that unless their standard of performance was
raised at least one hundred per cent, their services
would not be required after the end of the current
month.</p>

<p class="indent">Next came a brief but painful interview with
Mr. Murgatroyd, the Yorkshireman, on the subject
of perquisites and commissions. The motor
industry lends itself to the acquirement of pickings
more, perhaps, than any other trade of to-day, and
the long-headed Mr. Murgatroyd had made good
use of the opportunities thrown in his way for
something like ten years. Henceforth, Philip explained
to him, there must be no more clandestine
<i>douceurs</i> from tyre-agents, no more strictly private
rebates on consignments of petrol, and no more
piling-up of unconsidered trifles in customers' bills.
Before undertaking a repairing contract of any
magnitude, Mr. Murgatroyd must present a detailed
estimate of the cost, and the work was not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
be put in hand until the estimate was approved and
countersigned by the owner of the car.</p>

<p class="indent">To this Mr. Murgatroyd replied almost tearfully
that if Mr. Meldrum proposed to run the establishment
upon Sunday-school lines, the sooner they
put up the shutters the better.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does that mean that you want to resign your
post, Mr. Murgatroyd?&quot; asked Philip hopefully.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Murgatroyd was not to be caught.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all, sir,&quot; he said. &quot;I dare say we shall
take a little time to get used to one another's ways,
that's all; but in the end I'm sure we shall rub
along grandly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What Mr. Murgatroyd meant was:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a new broom. In a short time your
youthful zeal for reform will have abated, and we
can then slip back unto the old comfortable groove.
For the present I must make a show of complying
with your idiotic commands.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip understood this, and calculated that six
months of commercial austerity would set his
manager looking for a softer berth. Both sides having
thus decided to wait and see, the interview
terminated.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip next introduced his broom into the somewhat
Augean garage. Car-washers were straitly
informed that their duty was to wash cars and not
to rifle the tool-boxes and door-pockets thereof.
The current price of that fluctuating commodity,
petrol, as fixed from day to day by the brigands
who hold the world's supply in the hollow of their
unclean hands, was chalked up in a conspicuous
position every morning, in order that consumers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
might purchase at the market price and not at one
fixed by the foreman. Sundry members of that well-organized
and far-reaching Society for the Acquisition
of Other People's Property&mdash;the brotherhood
of chauffeurs who used the garage&mdash;were put
through a brief but drastic course of instruction in
the elementary laws of <i>meum and tuum</i>; and one
particularly enterprising member of the craft, to
whose possession a new and expensive jack, recently
the property of a gentleman from the country who
drove his own car, was traced after a systematic
and quite unexpected official enquiry, was directed
to remove himself and his vehicle to other quarters
as an alternative to prosecution.</p>

<p class="indent">Having in the space of three weeks achieved a
degree of unpopularity almost incredible to a man
who has hitherto encountered only the genial side
of his fellow creatures, Philip turned from the
garage to the office. Here his troubles were of a
different kind. Commercial arithmetic had no terrors
for him; the systematic filing of correspondence
and the compilation of cross-references appealed
readily to his orderly soul. His difficulties
arose not so much from these mechanical aids to
commerce as from the human agents in charge of
them. Mr. Atherton, the young gentleman who
presided over the show-room, was, as already indicated,
a square peg. The careers open to a younger
son of a well-connected but impecunious house are
strictly limited in number. Presuming, as is probably
the case, that the family resources are already
fully taxed in maintaining his elder brother in the
army, and that he himself is debarred through insufficiency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
of grey matter from entering one of the
three learned professions, our young English friend
is forced to the inevitable conclusion that he must
earn his living in some less distinguished field of
effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not in <i>trade</i>, of course, dear,&quot; says his lady
mother, with the air of a female Euclid throwing
off an elementary and self-evident axiom. &quot;But
anything else you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The unsophisticated observer might be excused
for imagining that the maternal proviso extinguishes
our young friend's prospects of a career altogether.
Not so. To the upper classes of England
there are trades and trades. You may become a
land-agent, for instance, without loss of caste; presumably
because you cannot possibly make any
money out of being a land-agent. You may also
become a stockjobber, possibly because a stockjobber's
earnings cannot by any stretch of the
imagination be regarded as the fruit of honest toil.
You may go to Ceylon, or Canada, or California,
and there, in the decent obscurity of a foreign
clime, live by the work of your own hands. You
may even go upon the stage, in a gentlemanly sort
of way. But you must not go into trade. You
must not buy or sell merchandise in the open market;
though, as stated above, you are perfectly at
liberty to sell what you have not got, and buy
what you could not pay for if you received it, in
the world of Bulls and Bears.</p>

<p class="indent">However,&mdash;no one seems to know why, but
the undisputable fact remains,&mdash;you may sell
automobiles for a living and remain a gentleman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
It is not known who discovered this providential
law of nature, but ever since its establishment
well-born young men have swarmed into the profession;
and now the humblest purchaser of an
automobile may quite reasonably hope to have his
cheque endorsed, and mayhap a cigar accepted, by
the descendant of a duke.</p>

<p class="indent">The innovation has proved a commercial success,
too, or we may be sure that it would not have
endured in the unsentimental economic world for
a twelvemonth. <i>Pace</i> Mr. Mablethorpe, the immaculate
young man who attends to our wants in
show-rooms knows his business. He is a fair mechanic,
a fearless driver, and an excellent salesman.
Customers of his own walk of life confide their
wants to him as to a brother, while plutocratic
but plebeian patrons frequently purchase a more
expensive car than they originally contemplated
through fear of losing his good opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">But there are exceptions, and Mr. Atherton was
one. He was grossly ignorant of the elements of
mechanics, he was unbusinesslike in his management
of correspondence, and he was rude to customers
without being impressive. He was also a
frequent absentee from his post on matinée days.
The indoor staff, down to the very office-boy, took
their tone from him; with the result that Philip, in
the execution of his duty in the office and show-room,
was enabled without any difficulty whatever
to eclipse the degree of unpopularity already
achieved by him in the garage and repair-shop.
But he ploughed resolutely on his way.</p>

<p class="indent">In order to be near his work he rented a small flat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
in Wigmore Street, and furnished it according to his
ideals of what was requisite and necessary. He
cooked his own breakfast, and took his other meals
at Frascati's.</p>

<p class="indent">Each afternoon an elderly and incompetent female
called, and&mdash;to employ her own grim expression&mdash;did
for him. That is to say, she consumed
what was left of Philip's breakfast, and made his
bed by the simple expedient of restoring the bedclothes
to their overnight position.</p>

<p class="indent">His bedroom furniture he bought <i>en suite</i> in
Tottenham Court Road, for seven pounds fifteen.
In his sitting-room he installed a large table, upon
which to draw up plans and specifications, and an
armchair. It did not occur to him that he required
any more furniture. He cooked his food at a gas-stove
and ate it off a corner of this table, sitting on
the arm of the chair. The sole ornament, upon his
mantelpiece was a model of the Meldrum Carburettor,
recently perfected and patented. He made no
friends and went nowhere. A woman would have
(and ultimately did) shed tears over his <i>ménage</i>.
But he was happy enough. Things, not People,
still held him bound.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet he was not utterly at peace with his
world. It is said that a woman is always happy
unless she has something to make her unhappy,
but that a man is never happy unless he has something
to make him happy. Up to this period of his
life Philip had never had to hunt for the sources
of happiness. His work, and the ever-developing
interests of youth, had kept him well supplied.
But now, at times, he was conscious of a shortage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
Under the increasing cares of existence mere <i>joie
de vivre</i> becomes insufficient as a driving-power,
and demands augmentation. Philip's present life&mdash;if
we except odd hours in the evening devoted
to the perfection of the Meldrum inventions&mdash;was
an ungrateful business at best. He had few
friends, and was not of the breed which can solace
itself with the companionship that can be purchased
in great cities. And therefore he began, inevitably,
to draw his necessary happiness from the
bank of the Future. Most of us come to this in
time, for few there be that are fortunate enough to
be able to subsist year in year out upon current
income. When we are young we draw upon the
Future, and when we are old we fall back (please
God) upon the Past. So Philip began to live for the
day on which his reforms should come to fruition,
and the work in the London offices find itself running
forward on oiled wheels. As for the Present&mdash;it
was a rotten business, but difficulties were
made to be overcome. <i>En avant!</i></p>

<p class="indent">But beyond these practical aspirations lay a
fairer region. Philip was in love. Not with any
material pink-and-white charmer, but, after the
perfectly healthy and natural manner of the young
man before he grows cynical or <i>blasé</i> with experience,
with Love itself. Only that. At present he
was more concerned with the abstract than the
concrete. At this period he was inclined to regard
matrimony much as a child regards cake&mdash;namely,
as a consummation to be achieved only after a long
mastication of bread-and-butter. At present he
was in the thick of the bread-and-butter. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
when he had worked strenuously for perhaps ten
years, he would assuredly encounter his Lady&mdash;he
had no clear idea what she was like, but he was
absolutely confident of her existence&mdash;and would
marry her. Then he would be paid in full. Troubles
would be halved and joys doubled, and life itself
would be the sweeter for the long years of hard service
and clean living and high endeavour that lay
at present between the dream and its fulfilment.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile he was content to hitch his wagon to
a star and proceed with the day's work. Business
first.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII</h2>

<p class="h3">PEOPLE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">For</span> six months Philip continued to give rope to
his esteemed colleagues Messrs. Atherton and Murgatroyd,
and within that period the pair duly
hanged themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Murgatroyd went first. For a whole winter
he waited patiently for Philip's reforming zeal to
spend itself; and then, finding that things were no
better but rather grew worse, he retired from the
conflict like a prudent man, and invested his not
inconsiderable savings in a wayside garage upon a
lonely stretch of the Great North Road, where
motorists, who are always in a hurry, would not be
disposed to haggle over the price of petrol or the
cost of tyre-repairs.</p>

<p class="indent">He parted from Philip without rancour, and
another and younger man was sent up from headquarters
to take his place.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Atherton was not so easy to eject, and was
only disposed of in the fulness of time and by the
process of filling up the cup. But he went at last,
and the change of atmosphere throughout the entire
establishment was most noticeable. The two
clerks and the office-boy carried out their duties
with what is known in transatlantic business circles
as &quot;a punch&quot;; the books were put in order; accounts
were straightened out; business increased;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
headquarters said encouraging things. For the
present Philip decided not to ask for a successor to
Atherton. He felt that he wanted to run the whole
Universe single-handed in those days.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course there were still crumpled rose-leaves.
There was Brand, for instance&mdash;Brand of the
repairing-shop. He was a strenuous worker and an
admirable mechanic, but he suffered intermittently
from a severe form of the popular disease of the
day&mdash;the disease which has its roots in the British
national policy of educating a man sufficiently to
make him discontented with his lot and then leaving
off. Brand was a Socialist, or a Revolutionist,
or an Anarchist. Philip could never find out which,
and the muddled but pertinacious Brand could
never enlighten him. The most noticeable feature of
his malady was an over-copious supply of what the
repairing-shop as a whole termed &quot;back-chat.&quot; Mr.
Brand was a stalwart upholder of what he called
the dignity of labour. He declined to be patronised;
he smelt patronage as an Orangeman smells Popery.
He also refused to accept an order with any
degree of cheerfulness; though, to do him justice,
once he had expressed his opinion of it and the
degradation which he incurred in accepting it, he
usually carried it out with efficiency and dispatch.
To one who knows his job almost anything can be
forgiven. We shall hear of Mr. Brand again.</p>

<p class="indent">Then there was Alfred, the office-boy. He was a
stunted but precocious child, with a taste for music
of a vibratory nature. He believed firmly in the
adage that a merry heart goes all the way, and
whistled excruciatingly from dawn till dusk. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
<i>tremolo</i> rendering of &quot;All That I Ask is Love&quot; appeared
to afford him the maximum of human enjoyment.
The departure of Mr. Atherton involved
him in some financial loss, for he had been employed
by that vicarious sportsman to execute turf
commissions on his behalf with an unostentatious
individual who conducted his business in the private
bar of an unassuming house of call in Wardour
Street. Consequently he considered it only just to
make things unpleasant for the new manager. This
object he accomplished in divers ways, which will
be obvious to any schoolboy. Philip suffered in
silence, for he was disinclined to further dismissals,
and, moreover, could not help liking the impudent
youth. His patience was rewarded; for one day,
with incredible suddenness, the nuisance ceased,
and Master Alfred became almost demonstrative in
his assiduity and doglike in his affection. Presently
the mystery was unfolded. Alfred had discovered
that that usurper, that tyrant, that slave-driver,
Mr. Meldrum, was the identical P. Meldrum who
had scored the winning try for the Harlequin Football
Club against Blackheath on the previous Saturday
afternoon. One day, after office hours, almost
timidly, he approached his employer and
presented a petition from his own club, the Willesden
Green Vampires, humbly praying that the
great Meldrum would honour this unique brotherhood
by consenting to become one of its Vice-Presidents.
Philip's heart warmed at the compliment,
and he complied gladly. He achieved further
and lasting popularity among the Vampires of
Willesden Green by officiating as referee in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
annual encounter with the Stoke Newington Hornets.
Verily the road to the heart of healthy young-manhood
is marked in plain figures.</p>

<p class="indent">A third and by no means unattractive rose-leaf
was Miss Jennings, the typist. She troubled Philip
considerably at first. He found her presence disturbing.
To him it seemed fundamentally wrong
that a man should sit in a room with his hat on while
a young and ladylike girl stood waiting at his elbow
for orders. He endeavoured to remedy these anomalies
by removing his hat in Miss Jennings's presence
and rising from his seat whenever she entered
his private room&mdash;courtesies which his typist
secretly regarded as due to weakness of intellect
rather than the instinct of chivalry, though she
valued them in her heart none the less.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a long time, too, before Philip grew accustomed
to dictating letters. His first incursion into
this enterprise gave him an uncomfortable quarter
of an hour. He began by ringing for Alfred, and
asking him to request Miss Jennings to be so good
as to come and speak to him for a moment. His
message was delivered by that youthful humourist
with elaborate ceremony,&mdash;this was in the pre-Willesden-Green
days,&mdash;coupled with a confident
assurance that it portended either a proposal of
marriage or &quot;the sack.&quot; Miss Jennings's reply
Philip did not catch, for only Alfred's raucous
deliverances could penetrate closed doors, but it
effectually silenced that young gentleman's guns.
His only discernible retort was &quot;Suffragette!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Miss Jennings appeared, slightly
flushed, and shut the door behind her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
&quot;You want me, Mr. Meldrum?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip rose to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Would you mind taking down one or two
letters for me, Miss Jennings?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, is that all?&quot; replied Miss Jennings, quite
composed again. &quot;Mr. Atherton usually just
shouts. I'll go and get my things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She returned with her writing-pad, and taking a
chair at Philip's elbow, sat down and regarded him
with an indulgent smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip began, huskily:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><i>The Britannia Motor Company, Limited, Oxford Street,
London, October.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings sat patiently waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that bit,&quot; she intimated gently.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip apologised, and continued hurriedly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;No, I expect you know that bit,
too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That bit's all right,&quot; said Miss Jennings calmly.
&quot;I wasn't to know who you were writing to. It
might have been your wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, who had not hitherto realised that it was
possible for a man to correspond with the wife of
his bosom by means of a machine operated by a
third party, apologised again, and added quite gratuitously
that he was not married.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings, having secured the information
she required, smiled forgivingly, and the dictation
proceeded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><i>We are in receipt of your letter of October the fourteenth.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
&quot;They usually say 'esteemed communication,'&quot;
said Miss Jennings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Philip humbly. &quot;Please correct
it.&quot; Miss Jennings did so. Philip, regarding
the curving neck and prettily coiled hair close beside
him, found himself wondering why such a
beautiful thing as a young girl should be compelled
to work for a living.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings looked up, and caught his eye.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; she enquired shortly.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip coloured guiltily, and continued:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>The cylinders you mention are cast in pairs, and their
internal diameter is one hundred millimetres, or</i>&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">He paused again. It seemed to him monstrous
that a woman should be compelled to waste her
youth taking down dry technical stuff like this,
when she ought to be outside in the sunshine. If a
woman must earn her bread, at least let her do
work that was woman's work and not man's leavings.
Her real mission, of course, should be to stand
apart from the struggle for existence, rendering first
aid to her man when he was stricken and companionship
when he was weary. But to sit&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings looked up again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We can go faster than this,&quot; she observed severely.
&quot;I'm a trained stenographer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, collecting himself, dictated an elaborate
formula for ascertaining the indicated horse-power
of the engine under discussion, at a pace which
caused the trained stenographer to pant for breath.</p>

<p class="indent">When he had finished, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are two more letters to do, Miss Jennings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
but perhaps you would like to rest for a moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thank you,&quot; said Miss Jennings. &quot;I'm not
made of sugar.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Possibly this statement was made&mdash;as many
feminine statements of the kind are made&mdash;in
order to be contradicted. More probably it was
intended as a test of character. Whatever it was, it
failed to intrigue Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, then,&quot; he said, and proceeded to dictate
another letter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I see how it is, Mr. Meldrum,&quot; said
Miss Jennings, unbending a little as their joint task
came to an end. &quot;You have not been accustomed
to working with a woman, and you think she can't
work the same as a man. You'll soon find out your
mistake. She works twice as hard, and makes less
fuss about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sure she does,&quot; said Philip meekly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's kind of you,&quot; proceeded Miss Jennings
maternally, &quot;to consider my feelings; but we shall
get through a great deal more work if you look on
me simply as a machine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not think that would be possible,&quot; said
Philip. &quot;I could not do my own work properly if I
thought you were not comfortable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment Miss Jennings eyed her employer
keenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, try, anyway,&quot; she urged. Experience had
taught her to beware of gentlemen who were too
solicitous about her comfort, and she had not yet
taken Philip's complete measure. &quot;I've been earning
my living for five years now&mdash;ever since I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
sixteen,&quot; she added carelessly&mdash;&quot;and I have found
that we do our work better and are much more
friendly and comfortable when the gentleman I am
working for doesn't worry too much about whether
I want a cushion for my back, and that sort of
thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see you are an independent lady,&quot; said Philip,
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Independent? Yes, that's me,&quot; agreed Miss
Jennings. &quot;You wouldn't take me for a Suffragette,
though, would you?&quot; she added, with a tinge
of anxiety in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't think I have ever met one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, go to one of their meetings&mdash;the Park
on Sunday, or somewhere&mdash;and you won't want
to meet one twice. What they're to gain by it all
beats me, let alone the show they make of themselves.
A woman has enough trouble coming to
her in life, without going out in a procession and
asking for it. That's how I look at it. Well,
I'll go and type these letters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings's presence gradually ceased to affect
Philip's powers of concentration, and he soon
dropped into the habit of regarding her as she had
asked to be regarded,&mdash;namely, as part of the
office furniture,&mdash;though he persisted in certain
small acts of consideration not usually offered to
articles of upholstery. Miss Jennings, finding that
her defensive attitude was entirely unnecessary,
promptly set out with the perversity of her sex&mdash;or
perhaps quite unconsciously&mdash;to stimulate her
employer's interest in her. It was a pleasant and
quite innocuous diversion, for Philip was usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
far too busy to take notice of her little coquetries,
and had far too much regard for the sanctity of
the unprotected female to respond to them if he
did.</p>

<p class="indent">He had grown so accustomed to regarding his
typist as a mechanical adjunct to the office typewriter
that he suffered a mild shock when one day
Miss Jennings remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So Mr. Atherton's gone? Well, he was no more
use than nothing in the office, but he wasn't a bad
sort&mdash;not if you took him the right way and kept
him in his place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was a friend of yours, then?&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, he used to take me out sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, the White City, or a theatre. It's a nice
change to be taken out by a gentleman sometimes.
When you go by yourself with your sister,&quot; explained
Miss Jennings, &quot;you go in the pit. When
any one like Mr. Atherton took me it was reserved
seats and dinner somewhere first. I love the theatre.
Don't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't go very often,&quot; confessed Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. Perhaps it is because I have no
one to go with.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings collected her papers and rose.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I must finish these,&quot; she said. &quot;Will
there be anything more this morning, Mr. Meldrum?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip surveyed the retreating form of Miss
Jennings with thoughtful eyes, and his heart smote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
him. By evicting the incapable Mr. Atherton he
had deprived this plucky, chirpy little city sparrow
of one of her most cherished recreations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh&mdash;Miss Jennings,&quot; he said nervously.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings turned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you care to come to the theatre with
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings's slightly anæmic features broke
into a frank smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's no good my pretending I don't want to go
to the theatre when I do,&quot; she remarked; &quot;so why
not say so? Where shall we go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anywhere you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-night, if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings considered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must see if my sister's to be at home,&quot; she
said. &quot;There are just two of us, and one always
stays in of an evening with mother. May I use the
telephone? My sister is with Goswell Brothers, in
Finsbury Circus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings sat down at the roll-top desk and
took the receiver off the hook. She flatly declined
to accept the assurance of the operator at the exchange
that the number she required,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="indent">(1) was out of order;</p>

<p class="indent">(2) was engaged;</p>

<p class="indent">(3) had not replied;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">and in the incredible space of four minutes succeeded
in establishing telephonic communication
with a place of business almost a mile away. A
much briefer but equally decisive encounter with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
the Finsbury Circus office-boy ended with the production
of Miss Jennings's sister, who was forthwith
addressed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That you, May dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;T'ck, t'ck,&quot; replied the instrument.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to go out to-night. Can you stay in with
mother, or are you doing anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Apparently the reply was satisfactory, for Miss
Jennings turned to Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be all right, Mr. Meldrum,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">They dined at Gatti's, and went on to the Gaiety.
Philip dropped readily into the etiquette of the
amphitheatre stalls, and provided Miss Jennings
with chocolates and lemon squashes during the
interval. Halfway through the second act he decided
that this was the pleasantest evening he had
spent since he came to London. What Miss Jennings
thought of it all he did not know, for she did
not tell him. Having speared her hat to the back
of the seat in front and dabbed her hair into position,
she sat absolutely silent, with her eyes fixed
unwinkingly upon the stage. For the time her perpetual
companion, the typewriter, was forgotten,
and she lived and moved in the world of romance,
where ladies were always fair and gentlemen either
gallant or entertaining. Occasionally, without removing
her gaze, she would call her host's attention,
by a half-unconscious gesture, to some particularly
attractive item of the entertainment.</p>

<p class="indent">When all was over she sighed resignedly and preceded
Philip out into the roaring Strand. Philip,
scanning the street for a disengaged cab, asked her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
where she lived. Miss Jennings gave him an address
in Balham.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We had better walk down to the Embankment,&quot;
he said. &quot;We might pick up a taxi or a hansom outside
the Savoy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings murmured something perfunctory
about the facilities offered to the public by the
London General Omnibus Company, and then
accompanied him to the Embankment.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently a hansom was secured, and Philip
handed his guest in, at the same time furtively
paying the driver.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night,&quot; said Miss Jennings, &quot;and thank
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They shook hands, for the first time in their
acquaintanceship. The cabman and his horse,
however, did not know this, and immediately
feigned a studious interest in something on the Surrey
side of the river.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip walked home, and let himself into his dark
and silent flat. On turning up the light he found
that the lady who &quot;did&quot; for him had omitted to
clear the breakfast-table. He accordingly set to
work to wash up himself, knowing full well that the
task would be even less congenial to-morrow morning.</p>

<p class="indent">As he groped philosophically in his tiny pantry
for a dish-cloth, it occurred to him that to a lonely
man female society is a very helpful thing. And he
was right. For it is so helpful that though a man
may, and often does, exist contentedly enough
without it, once he has tasted thereof he must have
it always or feel forever helpless.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
And yet, every day, refined young women are
surprised, and shocked, and indignant, when a
brother in London suddenly telegraphs home to
say that he has married a girl out of a tea-shop.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII</h2>

<p class="h3">MY SON TIMOTHY</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Philip</span> and Miss Jennings resumed business
faces next morning; and although they subsequently
indulged in other jaunts, one of which&mdash;a
Saturday-afternoon excursion to Earl's Court&mdash;included
sister May, no cloud of sentimentality
ever arose between them to obscure the simple clarity
of their relations. Miss Jennings was much too
matter-of-fact a young person to cherish any romantic
yearnings after her employer. She was not
of the breed which battens upon that inexpensive
brand of literature which converts kitchenmaids
into duchesses. She recognised Philip for what he
was&mdash;a very kind, rather shy, and entirely trustworthy
gentleman&mdash;and accepted such attentions
as he offered her with freedom and confidence. Nor
did Miss Jennings herself, beyond arousing in him
a dim realisation of the fact that the elixir of life is
not exclusively composed of petrol, make any direct
impression upon Philip's peace of mind. At present
his heart was too full of applied mechanics to have
room for tenderer preoccupations&mdash;a very fortunate
condition for a heart to be in when it belongs
to a young man who has yet to establish a position
for himself.</p>

<p class="indent">So life in the London offices went on for two years.
It contained a great deal of hard work and a great
deal of responsibility and a great deal of drudgery;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
but it had its compensations. Philip still played
Rugby football in the winter and suffered upon a
sliding-seat for the honour of the Thames Rowing
Club in the summer. There were visits to Cheltenham
to see Uncle Joseph, and to Red Gables to see
the Mablethorpes. There was the ever-enthralling
pageant of London itself. And there was the rapturous
day upon which a high official of the Company
arrived upon a visitation and announced,
after compliments, that the merits of the Meldrum
Automatic Lubricator (recently patented) had so
favourably impressed the directors that they had
decided to adopt the same as the standard pattern
upon all the Company's cars. Would Mr. Meldrum
enter into a further agreement with the directors to
give them the first refusal of any further inventions
of his? Those were days.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, finally, with a hilarious splash, came
Timothy.</p>

<p class="indent">He arrived one morning to take possession of a
six-cylinder Britannia touring-car which had just
been completed to his order&mdash;or rather, to the
order of an indulgent parent. He was a hare-brained
but entirely charming youth of twenty-two,
and Philip, who encountered far too few of his
own caste in those days, hailed him as a godsend.
Each happened to be wearing an Old Studleian tie,
so common ground was established at once.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip enquired after Mr. Brett, and learned that
that &quot;septic blighter&quot; (Timothy's description) had
retired from the position of Housemaster and had
been relegated to a post of comparative harmlessness;
but the old House was going strong.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
All this time they were examining the new car.
It soon became apparent that the technical knowledge
of Mr. Rendle (Timothy) was not of a far-reaching
nature, but his anxiety to improve it was
so genuine that Philip sent to the workshop for a
mechanic to come and lay bare various portions of
the car's anatomy. Presently that fire-eating revolutionary,
Mr. Brand, appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you are not in a hurry,&quot; said Philip to him,
&quot;we will take the top off the cylinders, and then I
can give you a demonstration.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No, Mr. Rendle was in no hurry. He was a
young man of leisure, it appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only too glad to spend such a profitable morning,&quot;
he said. &quot;Usually in bed at this time of
day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Brand, whose views upon the subject of the
idle rich were of a decided nature, looked up from
a contest with a refractory nut, and regarded Timothy
severely. Then, returning to his task, and
having exposed the internal secrets of the engine,
he plunged into an elaborate lecture, in his most
oppressive and industrious-apprentice manner,
upon big-ends and timing-gears. Philip did not interrupt.
Mr. Brand was fond of the sound of his
own voice, and was obviously enjoying his present
unique opportunity of laying down the law to a
wealthy and ignorant member of the despised
upper classes. He employed all the long words he
could think of. Timothy positively gaped with
admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say,&quot; he said, &quot;you ought to go into Parliament.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
&quot;P'raps I shall,&quot; replied the Industrious Apprentice
haughtily.</p>

<p class="indent">Evidently with the intention of resuming his interrupted
discourse, he cleared his throat and took
a deep breath. Then, suddenly, his mouth closed
with a jerk, he turned a dusky red, and assumed
an ostrich-like posture over the cylinders of the
car.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's a trunk-call coming through for you,
Mr. Meldrum,&quot; said a clear voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip turned round, to find Miss Jennings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be back directly, Mr. Rendle,&quot; he said
to Timothy, and accompanied the typist to the
office.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brand is a great orator, Miss Jennings,&quot; he
remarked, as he sat down to the telephone.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings sniffed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That hot-air artist?&quot; she replied witheringly.
&quot;He's the laughing-stock of the place. Not that I
know him. We on the office-staff keep ourselves to
ourselves. We don't&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the trunk-call came through,
and the conversation terminated.</p>

<p class="indent">When Philip returned to the show-room, Mr.
Brand had completed his task and departed to his
own place.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our chatty friend,&quot; announced Timothy, &quot;has
put me up to most of the tips. I shall be a prize
chauffeur in no time.&quot; He surveyed the gleaming
car admiringly. &quot;She's a beauty. What should I be
able to knock out of her? Sixty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wow-<i>wow</i>!&quot; observed Mr. Rendle contentedly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
&quot;I don't mind laying a thousand to thirty that I
get my licence endorsed inside three weeks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, who regarded new machinery much as a
young mother regards a new baby, turned appealingly
to the cheerful young savage beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't push her too much at first,&quot; he said.
&quot;Give the bearings a chance for a hundred miles or
two. And&mdash;I wouldn't go road-hogging if I were
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy turned to him in simple wonder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what on earth is the use of my getting a
forty-horse-power car,&quot; he enquired almost pathetically,
&quot;if I can't let her rip?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are too many towns and villages round
London to give you much of a chance,&quot; said Philip
tactfully. &quot;You will be able to find some good
open stretches, though, if you get right out west or
north,&quot; he added, as Timothy's face continued to
express disappointment. &quot;Or, I'll tell you what.
Take the car to Brooklands, and see what she can
do in the level hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The face of the car's owner&mdash;whose conscience
upon the subject of road-racing was evidently at
war with his instincts&mdash;brightened wonderfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is some notion,&quot; he cried. &quot;You're right.
Road-hogging is rotten bad form. We'll run this
little lad down to Brooklands&mdash;oh, so gently!&mdash;and
then go round the track all out. Will you
come with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather,&quot; replied the primeval Philip with
great heartiness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And come and dine at the Club afterwards,&quot;
added Timothy, in a final burst of friendliness.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
Within the exaggerated saucer constructed for
the purpose at Brooklands they succeeded in covering
seventy-three miles in sixty minutes, Timothy
deliriously clinging to the wheel and Philip
sitting watchfully beside him to see that centrifugal
force did not send the new car flying over the
rim into the conveniently adjacent cemetery of
Brookwood.</p>

<p class="indent">Thereafter they dined together at the Royal
Automobile Club, which seemed to Philip to contain
several thousand members. Members swarmed
in the great central hall, upon the staircase, and in
all the lofty apartments opening therefrom. There
appeared to be at least six hall-porters, and there
were page-boys innumerable, who drifted about in
all directions wearing worried expressions and
chanting a mysterious dirge which sounded like
&quot;Mr. Hah-Hah, please!&quot; There was a real post-office
in one corner, and a theatre ticket-office in another.
There were racquet courts, and a swimming-bath,
and a shooting-gallery, and a gymnasium,
and a bowling-alley, and a fencing-school.
Timothy confidently announced that there was a
golf links somewhere, but that he had not yet
found time to play a round owing to the excessive
length of the holes.</p>

<p class="indent">Eschewing what Philip's host described as the
&quot;cock-and-hen&quot; dining-room (where the two sexes
could be seen convivially intermingled, partaking
of nourishment to the sound of music), they
ascended in a lift to the first floor, where they sat
down in a vast refectory of a more monastic type.
Here one gentleman greeted them at the door, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
a second took Timothy's order for dinner, and
passed it on to a third. The dishes were served by a
fourth and cleared away by a fifth. The same ceremony
was observed in the ordering of wine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Less fuss up here than downstairs,&quot; explained
Timothy.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip enjoyed his meal immensely, though he
wondered, characteristically, if all these ministers
to his comfort&mdash;especially the page-boys&mdash;had
partaken, or would partake, of an adequate meal
themselves. Timothy, who contracted friendships
almost as impulsively as he purchased motors,
chattered to him with all the splendid buoyancy
and frankness of youth. His vocation in life, it appeared,
was that of Assistant Private Secretary to
a prominent member of His Majesty's Opposition.
The post was unpaid, and the duties apparently
nominal. But Timothy was quite a mine of totally
unreliable information upon the secret political
history of the day. He told Philip some surprising
stories of the private lives of Cabinet Ministers,
and foretold the date of the next general election
with great assurance and exactitude.</p>

<p class="indent">Later in the evening, as they drank coffee and
liqueurs in an apartment which reminded Philip of
Victoria Station (as recently rebuilt), Mr. Rendle
conducted his guest through a résumé of several
love-affairs&mdash;highly innocuous intrigues, most of
them&mdash;and added the information that &quot;that sort
of thing&quot; was now &quot;cut out&quot; owing to the gracious
and elevating influence of a being only recently encountered,
whom he described as &quot;the best little
girl that ever stepped.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
&quot;I don't know her very well yet,&quot; he concluded,
in a burst of candour. &quot;In fact, I don't even know
what her name is. I met her at a dance. All I could
find on my programme next morning was 'tight
pink head-band.' But I will find her again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sure you will,&quot; said Philip, who had yet to
learn that these final reformations of Timothy's
were of a recurrent character.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks, old friend, for your kind words,&quot;
replied the love-lorn youth. &quot;Tell me, how much
does a man require to marry on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thirty-five shillings a week,&quot; said Philip. &quot;At
least, so some of my colleagues tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have two thousand a year,&quot; said Timothy
doubtfully. &quot;I don't know how much that is a
week, but I'll work it out some day in shillings and
see. Anyhow, when I meet her, I shall take her out
in the new car. Are you married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's a pity. If you had been, your wife
might have chaperoned us. But if you get married,
let me know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at his watch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ten o'clock,&quot; he announced. &quot;Now, what
shall we do next? The resources of the Club are at
your entire disposal. Would you like to have a dry
shampoo, or fight a duel, or buy a postal order, or
what? Or shall we go to a theatre?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip mildly pointed out that most of the
theatres opened at eight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we will go to a music-hall,&quot; said the resourceful
Timothy. &quot;Waiter, is there a Tube Station
in the Club? I always forget.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
&quot;No, sir,&quot; said the waiter compassionately.
&quot;But there is a cold plunge-bath,&quot; he suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No good, I'm afraid; but thanks all the same,&quot;
said the polite Timothy. &quot;Get a taxi.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX</h2>

<p class="h3">PLAIN MEN AND FAIR WOMEN</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A fortnight</span> later Philip filled the vacancy
which had been caused two years previously by the
removal of Mr. Atherton by offering the post to
Tim Rendle&mdash;an offer which was accepted by
that ornament of the leisured classes with an enthusiasm
which would have surprised the horny-handed
Brand.</p>

<p class="indent">The experiment turned out a complete success.
It provided Master Timothy with some much-needed
employment, the Britannia Motor Company
with an admirable addition to its staff, and
Philip with a companion. Tim was a capital salesman.
He soon became a brilliant, if slightly reckless
driver; and in time he absorbed a fair working
knowledge of the mechanics of the automobile. He
possessed a charm of manner of which he was quite
unconscious, and a unique capacity for getting
himself liked. He fell in and out of love on the
slightest provocation, and rarely failed to keep
Philip informed of his latest entanglement.</p>

<p class="indent">Once he offered, as a supreme favour, to introduce
Philip to one &quot;Baby,&quot; who presided over a
small tobacconist's establishment in Wardour
Street. The interview was an entire failure. The
siren greeted Timothy and his abashed companion
most graciously, and was on the point, doubtless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
of making some witty and appropriate remarks,
when a piano-organ came heavily to anchor just
outside the door, and its unwashed custodians proceeded
to drown all attempts at conversation with
the reverberating strains of &quot;Alexander's Rag-Time
Band.&quot; Under such circumstances it was
impossible to look either affectionate or rakish. A
conversation conducted entirely by means of
smiles, however affable, and nods, however knowing,
rarely leads anywhere; and, Timothy having
intimated by a tender glance in the direction of
Baby and a despairing gesture towards the door,
that his heart was forever hers, but that for the
present they must part, the deputation filed ignominiously
out, one half of it feeling uncommonly
foolish.</p>

<p class="indent">Tim was fond of engaging in controversy with
Brand, and Philip frequently overheard such epithets
as &quot;gilded popinjay,&quot; and &quot;grinder of the
faces of the poor,&quot; exchanged for &quot;dear old soul,&quot;
and &quot;esteemed citizen,&quot; on the occasions when argument
and chaff clashed together in the garage or
show-room.</p>

<p class="indent">Tim created an impression in another quarter,
too, as a brief scrap of conversation will show.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think, Miss Jennings, that it would be a
pretty and appropriate thought if, for the future,
on arriving at the scene of my daily toil, I were to
kiss you good-morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think again,&quot; suggested Miss Jennings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not necessarily for publication,&quot; continued the
unabashed Timothy, &quot;but as a guaranty of good
faith. A purely domestic salute, in fact. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
little things have a softening effect upon a man's
character.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They seem to have had a softening effect upon
your brain,&quot; observed Miss Jennings swiftly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would do me good,&quot; urged Tim. &quot;I have no
one to kiss me now that my dear mother has been
called away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings looked up, deceived for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is your mother dead?&quot; she asked, more gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no. She is very well, thank you,&quot; said
Tim.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you said she had been called away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So she has.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To Holloway Gaol,&quot; explained Tim softly.
&quot;She is a Militant Suffragette. She tried to burn
down Madame Tussaud's. I miss her very much,&quot;
he added with a sigh. &quot;She comes out about twice
a week, under the Cat and Mouse Act. I meet her
at the prison gate with sandwiches, but she never
kisses me, because her mouth is too full. Will
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to me, Mr. Rendle,&quot; remarked Miss
Jennings, biting her lip, &quot;that you and I are wasting
our time. I have some work to do for Mr.
Meldrum. I'll trouble you to get out of this office
into the show-room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, Miss Jennings,&quot; replied Timothy,
striking an attitude. &quot;Good-bye! I will face this
thing like a man. I will fight it down. I shall
probably go and shoot big game&mdash;in Regent's
Park. May I send you a stuffed elephant? Or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
would you prefer a flock of pumas? I don't know
what a puma is like, but the keeper will tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The clatter of the typewriter drowned further
foolishness, and Timothy departed to his duties.
Here the incident would have ended, but for Miss
Jennings's feminine inability to leave well alone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haven't you got a young lady of your own?&quot;
she enquired one day of Tim, <i>à propos des bottes</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tim rapturously; &quot;I have.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, why&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy hastened to explain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I haven't met her yet. You cannot
expect a lady to kiss you for your mother,&quot; he
pointed out, &quot;until you have spoken to her. The
object of my affections lives in a castle in the air,
and she has never actually come down to earth yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Miss Jennings's attention had wandered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kissing is a queer thing,&quot; she said musingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn't seem so after a while,&quot; Tim hastened
to inform her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you had got a young lady of your own,&quot; continued
Miss Jennings, evidently debating a point
which had occupied her attention before, &quot;and you
were to kiss another one, in a manner of speaking
there would be no harm done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None whatever,&quot; agreed Tim heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What the eye doesn't see the heart doesn't
grieve over,&quot; continued Miss Jennings sententiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Selah!&quot; corroborated the expectant Timothy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if the eye <i>was</i> to see&mdash;my word!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings inserted a fresh sheet of paper
into the typewriter, and continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
&quot;Seems to me, kissing another young lady's
young gentleman is just like picking up her cup of
tea and taking a drink out of it. If she don't get to
know about it, no one's a penny the wiser or a
penny the worse. But if she does&mdash;well, she feels
she simply <i>must</i> have a clean cup! So don't you
take any risks, Mr. Rendle. You've such a silly
way of talking that I don't know whether you have
a young lady or not. If you haven't one now, you
will have some day. If you have&mdash;one that's at
all fond of you&mdash;and go kissing me, you will be
sorry directly afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Right Honourable Lady,&quot; chanted the
graceless Timothy, &quot;then resumed her seat amid
applause, having spoken for an hour and fifty
minutes. Very well, I will leave you. I shall go
and hold Brand's hand in the garage. He loves me,
anyhow. Hallo! I say&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings's serene countenance had flushed
crimson.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have I said anything to offend you?&quot; asked
Tim, in some concern. &quot;I am awfully sorry if I
have. I was only rotting, you know. I had no idea
Brand was a friend of yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings, recovering herself quickly, replied
with some asperity that he was no such thing,
and again announced that she had some work to
do and that the conversation would now terminate.</p>

<p class="indent">But it did not. There was a magnetism about
Tim which invited confidences.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Philip, old son,&quot; remarked Tim, as they
walked down Piccadilly the following Sunday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
afternoon, &quot;are you aware that our office has
become a home of romance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip did not reply. His thoughts for the moment
were centred upon more absorbing business.
Presently he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I shall take a long run to-morrow and
give it a proper trial on one or two really bad hills,
and then go down to Coventry and see Bilston
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tim sighed gently, and replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Permit me to remind you, O most excellent
Theophilus,&quot;&mdash;this was his retaliation for being
addressed as &quot;my son Timothy,&quot;&mdash;&quot;that to-day
is the Sabbath, and that we have left the Britannia
Motor Company and all its works, including the
Meldrum Never-Acting Brake, behind us for the
space of twenty-four hours. In addition, we have
washed ourselves and put on celluloid dickeys, and
are now going to the Park to see Suffragettes. Let
us be bright.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did I tell you the patent has been granted all
right?&quot; pursued Philip, referring presumably to
the Meldrum Never-Acting Brake.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did,&quot; said Tim resignedly. &quot;Seven times
yesterday and five this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Company simply must take it up,&quot; continued
the single-minded inventor. &quot;The brakes
of the Britannia cars have always been their weakness,
and now that we are building heavier and
heavier bodies things are riskier than ever. Our
present brake-power can't be developed any
further: even Bilston admits that. My brake is
magnetic&mdash;a different principle altogether. Its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
reserve of power is enormous. It would stop a
motor-bus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, dear old thing,&quot; said Tim soothingly. &quot;I
am sure it would. And if you don't come out of the
gutter on to the pavement you will stop one, too,
and then I shall have to waste a day taking you to
Kensal Green in instalments.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He linked his arm in that of his preoccupied
friend, and having drawn him into a place of safety,
repeated his former question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you aware that our office has become a
home of romance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip replied that he had not noticed it.</p>

<p class="indent">They were on their way to the Park, after the
fashion of good citizens, to enjoy the summer sunshine
and regale themselves with snacks of oratory
upon divers subjects, served gratis by overheated
enthusiasts in the neighbourhood of the Marble
Arch. After that they were to take tea with Timothy's
lady mother in Lowndes Square.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it has,&quot; affirmed Tim. &quot;Citizen Brand is
consumed by a hopeless passion for the haughty
Jennings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rot!&quot; said Philip, interested at last. &quot;How do
you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was having a brief chat with Miss Jennings
the other day&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were discussing the affections, and so on,&quot;
was the airy explanation; &quot;and when in the course
of conversation I happened to mention Brand's
name, the poor young creature turned quite puce
in the face.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
&quot;That rather sounds,&quot; commented the unsophisticated
Philip, &quot;as if the hopeless passion were on
Miss Jennings's side.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tim wagged his head sagely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear, no,&quot; he said. &quot;Not at all. In a woman,
that is a most misleading symptom. She told
me all about it. I notice,&quot; he added modestly,
&quot;that people confide in me a good deal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My son Timothy,&quot; said Philip, &quot;you are a gossiping
old wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The difficulty, I gather,&quot; continued Timothy,
quite unmoved by this stricture, &quot;lies in the fact
that they seem to have nothing in common whatsoever.
Otherwise they are admirably matched.
Socially, Miss Jennings is a young lady, while the
Citizen is only a mechanic, like ourselves. In politics,
Miss Jennings is a Conservative, while Brand
is an Anarchist. In religion, Miss Jennings is
Church of England, with a leaning to vestments,
whereas Brand thinks that heaven and earth were
created by the County Council, under the supervision
of the Fabian Society.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should have thought that it would have been
a most suitable match,&quot; said Philip. &quot;They would
be able to bring each other such fresh ideas.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is just what I told her,&quot; said Tim; &quot;but it
was no use. She said he was only a common person,
and did nothing but fill his head with stuff that
would put him above his station&mdash;night schools,
and debating societies, and Ruskin, and Eugenics,
and&mdash;and Grape Nuts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to me rather a laudable ambition on
the part of a common person.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
&quot;So I said, but I soon gathered that I had said
the wrong thing. It appears that the Citizen has
been trying to elevate Miss Jennings's mental outlook,
too. He took her to the theatre, and that
seems to have put the lid on everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why? I thought she liked the theatre.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; but the situation was mishandled. They
met by appointment outside a Lyons' tea-shop&mdash;Miss
Jennings in a dressy blouse and the Citizen in
the suit which he only wears as a rule on the anniversary
of the capture of the Bastille&mdash;and proceeded
to a hearty meal of buttered buns. Then,
instead of being taken to see Lewis Waller, as she
had secretly hoped, Miss Jennings found herself at
the Court, listening to a brainy rendering of
'Coriolanus' played by an earnest young repertory
company without scenery or orchestra.
I gather that they parted outside the emergency
exit, and went home in different 'buses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip listened to this highly circumstantial narrative
in silence. Finally he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm sorry for Brand. He may not be up to Miss
Jennings's standard of gentility, but he is the best
man we have, and I intend to make him foreman
next week. I bet you he finishes high up in the
Company's service.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tim shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall see,&quot; he said. &quot;Meanwhile, let us go
and study the Suffragette in her natural state. I
hear the Cause received a tremendous fillip last
Sunday. Two policemen were jabbed in the eye
with hatpins.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the Suffragettes were not so conspicuous as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
they had expected. They did discover a group of
intensely respectable and consciously virtuous
females haranguing a small and apathetic audience
from a lorry, but these had wrecked their chances
of patronage from the start by labelling themselves
(per banner) &quot;Law-Abiding Suffragists.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We want Ettes, not Ists,&quot; said Tim.</p>

<p class="indent">At length their attention was attracted by what
looked like a gigantic but listless football scrimmage,
some four or five hundred strong, slowly and
aimlessly circling about upon a wide grassy space.
It was composed mainly of anæmic youths smoking
cigarettes. But there was no sign of the ball. All
that indicated the centre of activity of this peculiar
game was the sound of some twenty or thirty
male voices uplifted in song&mdash;Timothy explained
that the melody was &quot;Let's All Go Down the
Strand and Have a Banana&quot;&mdash;somewhere about
the middle. A couple of impassive policemen appeared
to be acting as referees.</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy addressed a citizen of London who was
standing by.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is going on inside here?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sufferingettes, sir,&quot; responded the citizen
affably. &quot;The police won't let 'em 'old no meetings
now,&mdash;not off no waggin, that is,&mdash;so they 'as to
just <i>talk</i> to people, standin' about, friendly like,
same as me and you. There's a couple of them in
there just now&quot;&mdash;indicating the scrimmage with
his pipe. &quot;You'll 'ear 'em arguin', now and then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was right. Presently there was a lull among
the choristers. A high-pitched girlish voice became
audible, trickling through the press.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
&quot;And I ask all of you, if <i>that</i> isn't woman's work,
what is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The speaker paused defiantly for a reply. It
came, at once:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Washin', ducky!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd dissolved into happy laughter, and
the choir struck up &quot;Meet Me in Dreamland Tonight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip and Tim moved on. Philip felt hot and
angry that women&mdash;apparently young women&mdash;should
be subjected to such treatment as this. At
the same time he remembered Miss Jennings's dictum
upon the subject of asking for trouble, and
wondered what on earth the parents of the youthful
orators were thinking about.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they came to a group near the Marble
Arch. It was being addressed by two speakers
simultaneously. The first was an angry-looking old
gentleman with a long white beard. He was engaged
in expounding some peculiar and (to judge
from his apparent temperature) highly contentious
point of doctrine to a facetious audience; but it was
impossible to ascertain from his discourse whether
he was a superheated heresy-hunter, an evangelical
revivalist, or an out-and-out atheist. This is a
peculiarity of the Hyde Park orator. Set him on
his legs, and in ten minutes he has wandered so far
from the point&mdash;usually through chasing an interrupter
down some irrelevant byway&mdash;that it is
difficult to tell what his subject is and quite impossible
to discover which side he is on. As Philip and
Timothy strolled up, the bearded one parted company
with the last shreds of his temper, chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
owing to the remorseless hecklings of a muscular
Christian (or atheist) who was discharging a steady
stream of criticism and obloquy into his left ear at
a range of about eighteen inches; and partly by
reason of the distraction caused by the voice of
the other speaker, a pock-marked gentleman in a
frock-coat and bowler hat, who, with glassy eyes
fixed upon some invisible textbook suspended in
mid-air before him, was thundering forth a philippic
in favour of (or against) Tariff Reform.</p>

<p class="indent">With gleaming spectacles and waving arms, the
old gentleman turned suddenly upon the heckler.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Out upon you!&quot; he shrieked. &quot;I despise you; I
scorn you; I spit upon you! Plague-spot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What abaht the Erpostle Paul?&quot; enquired the
Plague-Spot steadily, evidently for the hundredth
time.</p>

<p class="indent">This naturally induced a fresh paroxysm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miserable creature!&quot; stormed the old gentleman.
&quot;Having eyes, you see not! Having ears,
you hear not! What did Charles Darwin say in
eighteen-seventy-six?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd turned to the heckler, anxious to see
how this thrust would be parried. The heckler
pondered a moment, and then enquired in his
turn: &quot;What did the Erpostle Paul say in one-oh-one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd, evidently regarding this as a good
point, laughed approvingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll <i>read</i> you what Charles Darwin said,&quot;
spluttered the old gentleman, producing quite a
library from his coat-tail. He selected a volume,
and turned over the leaves with trembling fingers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
&quot;And now, gentlemen, as regards this question
of Exports and Imports,&quot; chaunted the Tariff Reform
expert. &quot;I will give you a few facts&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fictions!&quot; amended a humorous opponent.</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the old gentleman began to read,
in a hurried gabble, what Charles Darwin had said
in eighteen-seventy-six. The heckler allowed him
two minutes, and then suggested cheerfully:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And <i>now</i> let's git back to the Erpostle Paul.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And so on. Our friends moved away, for not far
off Philip's eye had discerned a familiar figure gesticulating
upon a rostrum. It was Brand. He was
addressing a considerable crowd, upon the edge of
which Philip and Timothy now took their stand.
Philip had never seen his colleague out of his overalls
before, and was struck with the man's commanding
presence and impassioned delivery.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Life?&quot; shouted Brand. His face was dead
white, but his eyes blazed. &quot;Life? What does life
mean to you?&quot; He surveyed his audience with profound
contempt. &quot;<i>Beer!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd accepted this bludgeoning in excellent
part.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you <i>do</i> with Life?&quot; continued the
speaker. &quot;The Life that is left to you when you
have worked twelve hours a day for some capitalist,
and slept eight more, and spent another two
coming and going from your work&mdash;your spare
time, I mean? How do you employ your Sundays?
Do you go and study Nature? Do you read elevatin'
literature? Do you cultivate your starving
minds? No! What do you do? You can't think of
anything better to do than to come here and listen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
to fools like me! That's the sort of mugs you
are!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This summary of the situation met with hearty
endorsement from all parts of the audience.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it ain't your fault,&quot; continued Brand compassionately.
&quot;You haven't ever been taught
what it <i>means</i> to enjoy Life. You haven't got the
time!&quot; He raised clenched hands to heaven.
&quot;Life! Life! It should be beautiful&mdash;glorious&mdash;sublime!
Look round you now! Look at those
trees! Listen to that music!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd, docile but a trifle mystified, obeyed.
Faintly to their ears across the Park came the
tremendous chords of the Pilgrims' Chorus from
&quot;Tannhäuser,&quot; played by the Grenadier Guards
Band.</p>

<p class="indent">Brand sank down over the rail of his platform
until his arms hung limply before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do these sights and sounds thrill us?&quot; he demanded
hoarsely. &quot;Do they move us? I'm asking
you. Do they? No! Not a thrill, not an emotion!
Why? Because we haven't been educated up to
them, you and me. We're only the People. We've
always had to go to work, work, work! There's
never been any <i>time</i> for us to learn of the beauty
that Life holds for us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd was listening now, as it always will to
a <i>cri du c&oelig;ur</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The man swept on, all aflame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take music! What does it mean to us? Nothing&mdash;absolutely
nothing! Can you and I interpret
a symphony? Not on your life: we've never
been taught!&quot; His voice rose to a scream. &quot;And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
what sort of music <i>do</i> they hand out to us as a rule&mdash;us,
the People!&mdash;yes, and we lap it up? <i>Ragtime!
R-r-ragtime!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip and Tim turned away soberly enough.
The spectacle of an immortal soul beating its
wings against prison-bars does not lend itself to
flippant comment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Citizen may be a muddle-headed crank,
Phil,&quot; said Timothy, &quot;but he is a man for all that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip did not hear, though he would have agreed
readily. He was wondering why the haughty Miss
Jennings should patronize Mr. Brand's meetings.
Still, there she was, endeavouring to take cover
from his observation behind a small but heated
debate which had arisen between a gentleman with
a blue ribbon and another with a red rose. Timothy
caught sight of her, too, and promptly rushed
in where Philip feared to tread.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-afternoon, Miss Jennings,&quot; he said.
&quot;I'm surprised to find you, with your strict Conservative
principles, coming out to encourage such
a low entertainment as this.&quot; He indicated Mr.
Brand, now working up to a peroration.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings stiffened indignantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose I can come out and amuse myself listening
to a pack of nonsense if I like, Mr. Rendle,&quot;
she said, &quot;the same as any one else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think of Mr. Brand as a
speaker?&quot; asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn't listening to him particularly,&quot; said
Miss Jennings, untruthfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think of his views on ragtime?&quot;
enquired Tim.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
&quot;I think they are silly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you interpret a symphony, Miss Jennings?&quot;
asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; confessed the girl reluctantly; &quot;I can't
say I can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe you are a Socialist, too, Miss Jennings,&quot;
said Tim, shaking his head sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings, after an unsuccessful attempt to
wither him with a glance, passed on.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Philip received a scalding cup of tea from his
hostess, and lowered himself timidly to a seat beside
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am so glad to make your acquaintance, Mr.
Meldrum,&quot; said Lady Rendle. &quot;I have heard so
much of you from my boy. One likes to meet some
one one knows takes an interest in one's belongings,
doesn't one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, painfully unravelling this sentence, suddenly
caught his hostess's eye, and realised that
an answer was expected of him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, <i>sforzando</i>. &quot;Oh, yes! One
does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Graciously directed to help himself to something
to eat, he dipped blindly into the nearest dish, with
the result that he immediately found himself the
proprietor of a bulky corrugated tube of French
pastry, with cream protruding from either end. He
surveyed it miserably, wondering dimly if it would
be possible to restore it without attracting attention.
He was frustrated by Lady Rendle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like to see a young man,&quot; she said approvingly,
&quot;who is not afraid of tea and sweet cakes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
There are far too many of them nowadays who
consider it beneath their dignity to take tea at all.
Caviare sandwiches and whiskey-and-soda are all
they will condescend to. And now,&quot; she added
briskly, &quot;I want to introduce you to a charming
girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The quaking Philip, with his bilious burden, was
conducted across the room and presented to a
pretty girl in a hat which for the time being deprived
its wearer of the use of one eye.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is Mr. Meldrum, Barbara dear,&quot; announced
Lady Rendle. &quot;Miss Duncombe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, still bitterly ashamed of his tea, achieved
a lopsided bow, and Lady Rendle departed to her
own place.</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy, who had been engaging Miss Duncombe
in animated conversation, supplemented
the introduction with a few explanatory comments.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Babs, old thing,&quot; he announced to the damsel,
rising to give his seat to Philip, &quot;you must be
gentle with my friend Theophilus. He is fierce if
roused, and should on no account be irritated while
having his tea; but when properly handled will be
found perfectly tractable. He is not married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tim,&quot; replied Miss Duncombe, &quot;I hate you.
Go away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By all means,&quot; said the unruffled Timothy.
&quot;See you at the Venners' dance on Thursday.
Keep me all the odd numbers up to supper and
everything after, will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Miss Babs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks awfully,&quot; replied Timothy gratefully.
&quot;So long!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
He departed, leaving Philip alone with the girl.
He regarded her covertly. Miss Babs Duncombe
was a fair sample of the <i>ingénue</i> of the present day.
She was exquisitely pretty, beautifully dressed; her
complexion had been supplemented by art; and her
tongue spoke a strange language.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tim is rather a little pet, isn't he?&quot; she observed
to Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, who had been blinking nervously at Miss
Babs's sheeny silken insteps, looked up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is a great friend of mine,&quot; he said, &quot;but I
am afraid I have never regarded him as a pet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see you are a literal person,&quot; observed Miss
Duncombe. &quot;I must be careful. What shall we
talk about? What interests you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip pondered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Machinery,&quot; he said at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How pathetic!&quot; was Babs's response. &quot;What
else? Do you tango?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you skate?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have never seen you at Princes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have never been there,&quot; confessed Philip,
feeling very much ashamed of himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How tragic! Where <i>do</i> you go? Is there another
place?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I skate&mdash;whenever there is a frost,&quot; said
Philip. &quot;I am rather bucolic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you mean on ponds, and that sort of
thing,&quot; said Miss Duncombe gently. &quot;You
shouldn't, you know. It's not done now. Are
you very fond of exercise?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
&quot;I take all I can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So do I. I adore it. Do you hunt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Once in a way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Polo?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You <i>are</i> a monosyllabic man! What do you
go in for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rugby football.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Duncombe shivered elegantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How very quaint&mdash;and how squdgy!&quot; she
said. &quot;I am afraid you are a Cave Man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some other girls and I,&quot; explained Miss Babs,
&quot;have a sort of little society of our own, called the
Idealists. Our <i>séances</i> are simply too thrilling. We
sit on cushions round the floor and smoke Russian
cigarettes and drink the most divine liqueurs&mdash;pink
or green or gold&mdash;and have the duckiest
little debates.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, dumbly gripping the tube of French
pastry, gaped, quite frankly. This eccentric young
female was an entirely new type to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you debate about?&quot; he asked respectfully,
sipping his tea, which by this time was stone
cold.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Miss Babs vaguely, &quot;subconscious influences,
and soul-harmonies, and things like that.
We divide men and women into various classes.
Men like you are Cave Men. Most of the Cave
Men I know are soldiers. Then there are Soul
Men&mdash;actors, and musicians. Then creatures who
do nothing but crawl about in beautiful clothes
are Thing Men. Men with shiny faces and hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
hands are Butter Men. We divide women differently.
Most of them are Impossibles, but there are
a good many All-Buts. Life is so varied. The human
soul, with all its infinite shades of colour&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, quite intoxicated by the exotic atmosphere
in which he found himself, bit heavily and
incautiously into the roll of pastry. Straightway
from either end there sprang a long and sinuous
jet of clotted cream. The rearmost section shot
violently down his own throat, nearly choking
him; that in front descended upon the inlaid parquet
floor in a tubular cascade, where it formed an
untidy and conspicuous ant-hill.</p>

<p class="indent">In a moment one of Miss Duncombe's daintily-shod
feet slid forward, her skimpy skirt forming a
promontory which effectually hid the disaster from
the eyes of others&mdash;especially Lady Rendle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mop it up quickly,&quot; she said in an excited
whisper. &quot;Take your handkerchief&mdash;anything!
No one will see.&quot; She spoke breathlessly, with all
the zeal of a faithful sister screening a delinquent
small brother from the wrath to come.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, as he bent confusedly down to clear up
the mess, recognised with genuine pleasure that
for all her soulfulness and pose Miss Babs Duncombe
was nothing more, after all, than a jolly
little schoolgirl suffering from a bad attack of
adolescence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was the sweetest thing that ever happened,&quot;
said Babs, after all traces of havoc had
been obliterated. &quot;If you could have <i>seen</i> yourself
when the cream squirted out of the end! I must
tell the Idealists about it at the next <i>séance</i>. Now, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
must not laugh any more, or I shall get a purple
face. Tell me, is my nose shiny?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She submitted her peach-like countenance to
Philip's embarrassed inspection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It looks all right,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't believe you,&quot; said Miss Duncombe, and
extracted a small mirror from a gold bag. She
viewed herself with a gasp of dismay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can you say such a thing?&quot; she exclaimed
indignantly.</p>

<p class="indent">Swiftly she produced a powder-puff, and proceeded
to repair the ravages caused by excessive
mirth in a warm room. The unsophisticated Philip
gazed at her, speechless, and was still gazing when
he was whirled away by his indefatigable hostess&mdash;Lady
Rendle believed in keeping her male callers
circulating: it enabled those whose conversational
stock-in-trade was scanty to indulge in the luxury
of repetition&mdash;to the side of one Sheila Garvey.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Garvey began at once:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you play cricket at all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not now,&quot; said Philip; &quot;but I play&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Apparently Miss Garvey had no desire to discuss
other pastimes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still, you go to Lords occasionally, I suppose,&quot;
she suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, Philip went to Lords.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I hope you are Middlesex.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yes; on consideration, Philip was Middlesex.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My <i>fiancé</i> plays for Middlesex,&quot; mentioned
Miss Garvey carelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, secretly blessing this unknown cricketer,
said eagerly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
&quot;I should like to hear about <i>him</i>&quot;&mdash;implying
that the rest of Middlesex did not matter.</p>

<p class="indent">After that he enjoyed a welcome rest. By
occasionally supplying such fuel as, &quot;What did
he do against the Australians in the fourth Test
Match?&quot; or, &quot;What does he think about the off-theory?&quot;
he maintained a full head of steam on
Miss Garvey for something like twenty minutes.
He sat thankfully listening and watching the clock,
secure in the knowledge that time was slipping
away and that Timothy had promised that their
call should not extend beyond half-past five.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another five minutes and we are out of the
wood,&quot; he said to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">But he was mistaken. He had just accompanied
Miss Garvey (chaperoned, of course, by the
<i>fiancé</i>) step by step, match by match, through an
entire cricket-tour in the Antipodes, including five
Test Matches (with a special excursion up-country
in order to see the <i>fiancé</i> score a century against
Twenty-Two of Woolloomoolloo), when his hostess
once more intervened, with the inevitable sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Meldrum, I want to introduce you to a
charming girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Once more, with leaden footsteps, Philip crossed
the room. Timothy apparently had forgotten all
about both him and the time. A despairing glance
in his direction revealed him ensconced in a window-seat
with Miss Babs Duncombe. In that fastness
he remained for another forty minutes. When
at length, restored to a sense of duty by the departure
of Miss Duncombe and his introduction to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
a grim young woman interested in Foreign Missions,
Master Timothy set out to reclaim his long-lost
friend, Philip had passed through the hands,
<i>seriatim</i>, of a damsel who had besought him to
obtain for her autograph-book the signature of a
certain music-hall comedian (mainly noted for an
alcoholic repertoire and a deplorable wardrobe)
whom she affirmed she &quot;dearly loved&quot;; another
who endeavoured to convert him to the worship of
Debussy, not desisting until she discovered that
Philip imagined Debussy to be a French watering-place;
and a third, whose title to fame appeared to
be founded upon the fact that she had once bitten
a policeman in order to demonstrate her fitness to
exercise the Parliamentary franchise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, we will go to the Club and drink deep,&quot;
said Timothy, as they turned out of Lowndes
Square. &quot;You haven't thanked me yet, O
brother, for your P.S.A.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip eased his collar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Timothy, my son,&quot; he observed, &quot;I fear I must
give up all thoughts of becoming a social success.
I am only a Cave Man.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX</h2>

<p class="h3">THE PROVING OF THE BRAKE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> Monday morning Philip rose early. He had a
hard week before him, for besides performing his
usual duties&mdash;and their name was legion at this
busy season of the year&mdash;he hoped to devote an
afternoon to an exhaustive trial of the Meldrum
Automatic Electro-Magnetic (described by the
ribald Timothy as the Ought-to-Scrap-It, Don't
You-Forget-It) Brake. He was anxious, later in
the week, to run down to Coventry and persuade
the conservative Bilston to extend official recognition
to his offspring.</p>

<p class="indent">He devoted two hours before breakfast to the
more tender adjustment of the mechanism of the
brake, which he had attached to the service-car
provided for his use by the Company. The car
consisted mainly of a long, lean, powerful chassis,
destitute of ornament and fitted with a skimpy and
attenuated body of home manufacture. He was
assisted in his operations by Mr. Brand, once more
unclothed and in his right mind. Brand had taken
a reluctant but irresistible interest in the evolution
of the Brake. Indeed, one or two practical suggestions
of his had been incorporated in the final
design.</p>

<p class="indent">At last the work was completed. Philip climbed
out of the pit and disconnected the inspection
lamp.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
&quot;That's great, Brand,&quot; he said. &quot;Thank you for
all your help. If the Company takes the invention
up I hope you will accept five per cent of the first
year's royalties as your just commission.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was an unnecessarily handsome offer, but Mr.
Brand was not particularly cordial in his thanks.
He would have preferred, on the whole, to receive
nothing whatever for his assistance, and so be able
to announce that Labour (himself) had done the
work, while Capital (Philip) drew the profits.</p>

<p class="indent">Early in the afternoon, after a crowded morning
in the office, Philip ordered round the service-car
and set off upon his trial trip. First of all he tested
his Brake in the surging torrent of Oxford Street.
In this enterprise he received invaluable assistance
from that strange animal, the pedestrian, and wondered
for the hundredth time, as he eluded a panic-stricken
party of shoppers who had darted out of
Marshall and Snelgrove's apparently for the express
purpose of getting run over, why it is that
the ordinary citizen&mdash;even the self-confident
Cockney&mdash;who desires to cross a crowded street
should invariably put his head well down and run
rather than keep it well up and walk. However, he
was gratified to find that the Brake performed its
duties without undue suddenness and held the car
without apparent effort.</p>

<p class="indent">At the Marble Arch he turned into the Park, and
gliding sedately past the long rows of green chairs,
emerged at Albert Gate and sped down the Fulham
Road. Presently he was across Putney Bridge.
Twenty minutes later he cleared Kingston, and
leaving Suburbia, with its tramlines and other impedimenta,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
far behind him, headed joyously for the
Surrey hills.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a perfect afternoon in June, and Philip,
who for some reason was in a reminiscent mood,
wandered back in his thoughts to his first motor
ride&mdash;that ecstatic and epoch-making journey
in Mr. Mablethorpe's fiery chariot, Boanerges of
blessed memory.</p>

<p class="indent">Boanerges, alas, was no more. A fighter to the
last, he had met his Waterloo more than two years
ago in a one-sided but heroic combat with a Pantechnicon
furniture-van. Always a strategist,
Boanerges had taken the van in the rear, charging
through its closed doors with devastating effect
and recoiling into the roadway after the impact,
with the first fruits of victory, in the shape of a
wash-hand stand, adhering firmly to his crumpled
radiator. But his triumph was momentary. The
radiator stood gaping open; the cooling waters
imprisoned therein gushed forth; the temperature
of Boanerges rose to fever-heat; and as the faithful
engine refused under any conditions to stop running,
the whole sizzling fabric rapidly heated itself
to redness and finally burst into flame, furnishing
the inhabitants of Maida Vale with the finest and
most pestiferous bonfire ever seen in Watling
Street. So perished Boanerges, and the wash-hand
stand with him. <i>Pax cineribus.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Roaming further down the avenues of remembrance,
Philip came next to the <i>affaire</i> Pegs, and
the house on Hampstead Heath. Performing a
brief sum in mental arithmetic, he calculated that
Pegs would now be about twenty-two. Perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
she was married by this time. Indeed, it was highly
probable, for Montagu Falconer was not precisely
the sort of person with whom one would choose to
dwell longer than was absolutely necessary. Still,
it was odd to think of such a little girl being married.
He recalled some of their quaint childish
conversations, and was conscious of a sudden
<i>desiderium</i>&mdash;there is no exact word for it in English&mdash;for
the days that were no more. It would
be pleasant, he reflected, to have some one beside
him now&mdash;especially some one with kind brown
eyes and wavy hair&mdash;to cheer him with her presence
and act as a repository for his private
thoughts and ambitions. However, his own
proper Lady would come along some day. Would
she be like Pegs, he wondered?</p>

<p class="indent">He touched the accelerator with his foot, and the
car began to breast the three-mile slope of Wickmore
Hill. It was on the farther side that he proposed
to test his Brake.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, along a road running almost parallel
with Philip's and ultimately converging on Wickmore
Hill itself, came another car. It was a Britannia,
of a four-year-old pattern. It was driven
by a gentleman with a yellow beard, into which
streaks of grey had made their way. Beside him
sat a girl. The gentleman, her father, had just completed
a sulphurous summary of the character of
the man who had designed the carburettor of the
car&mdash;not because of any inherent defect in the
carburettor itself, but because the gentleman, for a
variety of reasons, the most cogent of which was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
entire ignorance of the elements of motor mechanics,
had twice stopped his engine in the course of
five miles.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they emerged from the side road on to
the summit of Wickmore Hill. The gentleman
stopped the car by a fierce application of the
brakes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall write to the band of brigands who sold
me this condemned tumbril,&quot; he announced, &quot;and
ask for my money back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Considering that we have had the car for nearly
four years now,&quot; remarked his daughter calmly,
&quot;won't they think we have been rather a long time
making up our minds about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't be ridiculous! How could I detect the
fault when I had never driven the car myself until
to-day?&quot; snapped the car's owner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think,&quot; said the girl, &quot;that if there
had been a fault Adams would have noticed it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This apparently harmless observation roused
quite a tempest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Adams? That numskull! That bumpkin!
Haven't I been compelled to dismiss Adams from
my service for gross incompetence only yesterday?
How would <i>he</i> be likely to notice faults in
a car?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know, I'm sure,&quot; was the unruffled
reply, &quot;except that he was a trained mechanic and
a good driver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment a Gabriel horn fluted melodiously
in the distance. Philip was coming up behind
them, climbing the hill at thirty miles an hour.
Seeing a car in front of him at a standstill, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
slowed down punctiliously and glanced in an enquiring
fashion at its occupants as he slid past.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Filthy road-hog!&quot; bellowed the gentleman at
the wheel; and Philip went on his way.</p>

<p class="indent">The gentleman turned to his daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, let's have no more nonsense about
Adams,&quot; he said. &quot;I admit he had a wife and four
children, but you can hardly hold me responsible
for that. Moreover, he was a yahoo. He decorated
the interior of the garage&mdash;my garage&mdash;with
chromolithographs, and his wife kept wax fruit
under a glass case in her parlour window. I have
dismissed him, and there is an end of it. Let us
cease to be sentimental or maudlin upon the
subject.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might have given him a character,&quot; said
the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I had,&quot; replied her father grimly, &quot;he would
never have obtained a situation again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl changed the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you think,&quot; she said, &quot;that if we are
really going to call on the Easts, we had better be
getting on? And go gently. The foot-brake is a
good deal worn, and the side-brake won't hold this
heavy car if it gets on the run down this hill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If there is one thing,&quot; replied her amiable
papa, &quot;about this miserable and untrustworthy
vehicle which can be relied upon at all, it is the
efficiency of the brakes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They set off with a jerk.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Philip, a little startled at the reception
accorded to his tacit offer of assistance, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
running down Wickmore Hill. It was a long descent&mdash;nearly
three miles&mdash;but was not steep,
and there were no sharp curves until near the bottom.
It was a useful spot for brake-tests.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder who that old ass was,&quot; mused Philip.
&quot;Rum bird. One of our cars, too. There was
something familiar about his voice. Road-hog, indeed!&quot;
Philip grunted indignantly, for he was a
virtuous motorist. &quot;Now I will really hog it a bit:
this is a lovely piece of road. I'll let the old car rip
for a couple of hundred yards and then see what
the Ought-to-Scrap-It will do. There was a girl
with him, too. I wonder what her face was like,
behind that thick blue veil. Now, then, old friend,
put your back into it!&quot; He patted the steering-wheel
affectionately. &quot;Off you go!... No, steady!
Wait a minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He closed down the throttle, for another car was
coming down the hill behind him, and he intended
to let it pass in order to have a clear road for his
own operations. He looked round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What in thunder&mdash;&quot; he began.</p>

<p class="indent">All was not well with the oncoming car. The
horn was being blown unceasingly, and some one
appeared to be shouting. As Philip looked, he saw
that it was the Britannia car which he had passed
at the top of the hill. It was going thirty miles an
hour and swaying a little from side to side. Next
moment it was past him.</p>

<p class="indent">The gentleman at the wheel turned to Philip as
they shot by.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are running away, damn you!&quot; he bawled.</p>

<p class="indent">It was what geometricians call a self-evident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
proposition, though why Philip should be damned
because an incompetent stranger had allowed his
car to get out of control was not readily apparent.
Still, there was no time to sift the matter. Something
must be done&mdash;promptly&mdash;or there would
be a hideous disaster. Besides, the man at the
wheel was no stranger. Philip recognized him now.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip's foot came down upon the accelerator,
and the long low car leaped down the hill. Philip's
mind was suddenly and tensely clear. There was
only one thing to do, and the Meldrum Ought-to-Scrap-It,
Don't-You-Forget-It Brake would have
to do it. Otherwise&mdash;!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lucky there's no sharp turn for nearly two
miles,&quot; he muttered to himself between his locked
teeth. &quot;Pray God we meet nothing coming up the
other way! Now to get past! My word, they are
swinging!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Next moment he was abreast of the flying car.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get right behind me, if you can,&quot; he shouted,
&quot;and I'll try to stop you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The only response to this appeal was another
swerve on the part of the runaway, in avoiding
which Philip nearly cannoned into a tree at the
side of the road. The gentleman with the beard
appeared to have lost his head altogether. His
efforts to avoid disaster were now limited to swearing
volubly and blowing his horn. Philip noted
that the side-brake was full on; but it seemed to
have little effect in checking the car.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stick to your <i>wheel</i>, you fool!&quot; he shouted with
the full strength of his lungs.</p>

<p class="indent">The gentleman responded with a fresh outburst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
of vocal and instrumental exuberance. But suddenly,
just as Philip shot ahead, the girl in the blue
veil leaned over and gripped the wheel in her two
hands. Her parent immediately relinquished his
hold altogether, and devoted his undivided attention
to the horn.</p>

<p class="indent">Then followed the fullest and most eventful
minute of Philip's life.</p>

<p class="indent">He was ahead now&mdash;going perhaps fifty miles
an hour, but clear in front of the other car. He
knew he must act at once, for there was barely
half a mile of straight road left, and there were two
sharp turns at the foot of the hill. What he had to
do must be done instantaneously, and called for
superb driving. He wondered if the girl behind
could hold on long enough to give him a chance.
To steer a car steadily from any position except the
driver's seat is a difficult enough performance, but
to accomplish it when the seat is occupied by a
gesticulating lunatic is almost a physical impossibility.
Still, Philip had had time to note the
prompt and decisive way in which this girl had
grasped his purpose and carried out his instructions.
He felt somehow that those small gloved
hands could be trusted to cling gamely on until the
end of all things.</p>

<p class="indent">Glancing back, he saw that the other car was
now right behind him&mdash;seven yards or so. The
moment had come&mdash;the inventor's moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told Timothy it would stop a motor-bus,&quot; he
observed to himself. &quot;We'll see if it will stop two
cars!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Brake was controlled by a switch upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
steering-pillar. The farther the switch was pulled
over the stronger became the current which supplied
the Brake's magnetic force. But it was not
required yet. Philip hastily jammed on the side-brake,
which, though it could not check, sensibly
moderated the headlong speed of his car; and then,
getting both hands back to the steering-wheel,
braced himself, and leaning well back, waited for
the impact of the runaway.</p>

<p class="indent">It came, but not too severely. By good luck or
good management the pursuing car struck Philip's
fairly and squarely in the back, and the two raced
on together down the hill, locked together like
engine and tender, the sorely handicapped little
<i>chauffeuse</i> behind exerting all her small strength to
keep her leading wheels from slewing round. The
shock of collision, coming where it did, sent a thrill
of satisfaction coursing up Philip's spine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, well done, well done, little girl, whoever
you are!&quot; he murmured enthusiastically. &quot;That
gives us a Chinaman's chance, anyhow. Now!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He pulled the switch of the Brake slowly over,
three parts of the way.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment nothing seemed to happen; and
then&mdash;oh, rapture&mdash;the rocking cars began to
slow down. The Brake was answering to the call.
The strain was immense, but the work was good.
On they tore, but more slowly and yet more slowly.
They were barely going twenty-five miles an hour
now.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip leaned hard back, gripping the wheel, and
exulted. They were going to stop. The Brake was
proved. Suddenly his eye caught a glimpse of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
red triangle. They were coming to the turns&mdash;sooner
than he expected, for the pace had been
terrific, and the whole incident had barely lasted a
hundred seconds as yet.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, they would just manage it, he calculated,
provided that the smoking brake-shoes held out.
They were running at a comparatively moderate
pace by this time. A single car could have taken
the approaching corner comfortably. The danger
lay in the likelihood that the car behind would
skid. Still, the little girl was steering like a Trojan.
They ought to get off with a shaking at the worst.</p>

<p class="indent">Round to the left they swung. Philip, glancing
over his shoulder, could see the girl behind frantically
wrestling with her steering-wheel. Next moment
they were round. She had succeeded. The
road was almost level now, but the second corner
was imminent, and in the reverse direction, for this
was what was technically known as an &quot;S&quot; turn.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip pulled his brake-switch into the very last
notch and put his wheel hard over to the right.</p>

<p class="indent">What happened next he never rightly knew. His
car took the corner well enough. But then, instead
of proceeding upon its appointed way, it continued
to come round, and still farther round, in a giddy,
sickening circle, until it threatened to mount the
bank beside the road. Philip promptly spun his
wheel over to the left, but all in vain. Next moment
his car was right across the road; for the car
behind, instead of following its leader round the
bend, had pursued a straight course, pushing the
tail of Philip's long chassis before it. Philip could
feel his back-tyres sliding sideways over the smooth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
asphalt. He felt utterly helpless. The Brake could
do no more. It was not designed to prevent cars
from running away laterally.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly there came a loud report. &quot;Back
tyre!&quot; muttered Philip mechanically&mdash;and the car
gave a sudden lurch to the left. Then, without warning,
it turned completely upside down. The other
car, like a victor who sets his foot upon the neck of
the vanquished, mounted proudly on the wreck of
its prostrate preserver, and there poised itself&mdash;stationary
at last.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, unable to free himself, went over with his
car. &quot;I rather fancy the old man must have been
putting his oar in again,&quot; he said to himself, as the
road rose suddenly up to meet him.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">So the Meldrum Automatic Electro-Magnetic
Brake was proved. When they examined the car
afterwards it was found that though the brake-shoes
were scorched and damaged beyond recall,
the Brake itself was in perfect order.</p>

<p class="indent">The other car was hardly injured. Its occupants
were unhurt.</p>

<p class="indent">But Philip did not know this. He had ceased to
take any active interest in the proceedings.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Only for one brief moment during the subsequent
twenty-four hours did he exhibit any sign of intelligence
at all. This was when he woke up on his
way back to London. He found himself lying in a
smooth-running vehicle of some kind. The light
was uncertain, and his vision was somewhat obscured
by bandages; but he was dimly conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
that some one was sitting beside him&mdash;close
beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">He made an inarticulate sound. Instantly the
figure stirred and a face came very close to his.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip surveyed the face gravely, and remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Pegs!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then everything became blank again.</p>

<p class="h3">I</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Nine</span> o'clock, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The pert young housemaid entered Philip's bedroom,
deposited a basin of hot water beside his
bed, drew up the blinds, surveyed Tite Street, Chelsea,
in a disparaging fashion, and announced that
it was a nice day for the ducks.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, gathering from this observation that the
weather was inclined to be inclement, replied
sleepily but politely that rain made little or no
difference to his plans at present.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare say,&quot; retorted the housemaid. &quot;But it's
me afternoon out. And please, sir,&quot; she added,
recollecting herself, &quot;Miss Marguerite wants to
know if you are ready for your breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Philip. &quot;In a very few
minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When the housemaid had departed, he sat up in
bed as completely as splints and bandages would
permit, and prepared for breakfast. Then he lay
back in bed and waited, with his eyes fixed unwinkingly
upon the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently there was a rattle of silver and crockery
outside, accompanied by a cheerfully whistled
tune, and breakfast entered upon a tray.</p>

<p class="indent">Behind the tray came Peggy Falconer, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
been Philip's hostess now for the best part of three
weeks.</p>

<p class="indent">She greeted her patient with a maternal smile,
and enquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Slept well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leg troublesome?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. It seems to be joining up in first-class
style now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Concussion all gone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip knuckled his head vigorously all over, to
show that his skull was once more free from dents.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case,&quot; announced Peggy, &quot;I may possibly
let you have some letters to read. But I shall
wait until the doctor has seen you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, who had no desire whatever to receive
letters,&mdash;nor would have, until Fate separated
him again from Miss Peggy Falconer,&mdash;thanked
his hostess meekly, and proceeded to decapitate an
egg.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you feel strong enough to receive a visitor
to-day?&quot; continued Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who? Tim?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn't mean Tim, though I haven't the
slightest doubt that he will call,&quot; said Peggy, with
an enigmatic smile. &quot;This is a new visitor&mdash;Miss
Leslie. She used to be mother's greatest friend,
and&mdash;and she has always been very good to me.
I should like you to know her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this point the conversation was interrupted
by a roar from the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is Dad,&quot; explained Peggy, quite needlessly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
Montagu Falconer invariably adopted this
method of announcing his readiness for breakfast.
A commotion upon the ground floor merely signified
to Philip the intelligence that it was about
half-past nine, or half-past one, or eight in the
evening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid I am keeping you,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right,&quot; assented Peggy. &quot;You are. Eat
up your breakfast like a good little boy, and perhaps
I will come and see you again later.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And she sped out of the room and down the
stair, to quell a bread-riot. A woman with two
men on her hands is, indeed, a busy person.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip munched his breakfast in utter content.
He was convalescent now, though the first week or
so had been a bad time. He was only intermittently
conscious, and his injuries had combined to
render sleep a nightmare and wakefulness a throbbing
torment. But he would have gone through it
all again, and yet again, cheerfully, provided he
could have remained in the hands of his present
nurse. In the dim and distant past he had recollections
of another attendant,&mdash;a deft and capable
lady in a blue-and-white uniform,&mdash;but she
had disappeared long ago (friction with the master
of the house being the cause), and his whole illness
and recovery were summed up to Philip in the
single word, Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">For the Big Thing had happened. Philip was in
love. His long-expected Lady had come to him at
last&mdash;or rather, come back to him, after an interval
of years&mdash;grown up into a slim, elfin, brown-eyed
piece of Dresden china. She had gathered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
him up, crushed and broken, from the middle of a
Surrey highway, and had conveyed him straight to
her home in Chelsea, to be nursed and mothered
back into coherent existence. This, be it noted, in
the face of a strongly-worded and most enthusiastic
eulogy (from her parent) of the public hospitals
of the metropolis.</p>

<p class="indent">But Peggy had been quite firm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dad,&quot; she said, &quot;I don't think you quite realise
that he has saved your life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he has,&quot; said Montagu Falconer magnificently,
&quot;he shall be suitably rewarded.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy eyed her progenitor dispassionately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you are thinking of tipping him half-a-sovereign,&quot;
she said, &quot;I advise you not to. I happen
to know him. Now don't be a silly old curmudgeon,
but go and see if the ambulance is
coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu obeyed, grumbling. There were only
two women of his acquaintance who did not fear
him, and Peggy was one. In fact, Peggy feared
nothing, except spiders and the revelation of her
own feelings.</p>

<p class="h3">II</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how is the <i>tibia</i> of Theophilus this
morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy, entering the room like a gust of ozone,
sat down heavily by the patient's bedside and
slapped the counterpane heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just making both ends meet,&quot; replied the
owner of the tibia, shrinking nervously towards the
wall.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
&quot;Good!&quot; said Timothy. &quot;And is it well with the
solar plexus?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Try again,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy paused, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was under the impression that it was the
solar plexus,&quot; he said in a troubled voice. &quot;I know
it was a heavenly body of some kind. Ah, I have it.
The semilunar cartilage! How is the semilunar
cartilage this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip reported favourably.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cavities in the cranium now permanent, I
gather?&quot; continued Tim sympathetically. &quot;Prospect
of ultimate mental weakness confirmed&mdash;what?
Never mind! I'll get my late boss to provide
you with a permanent post under Government.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My skull,&quot; replied the patient mildly, &quot;is all
right, except when you make such an infernal noise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy was contrite at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noise? Tut-tut! Am I making a noise? This
will never do. Nervous and irritable patient&mdash;eh?
Must be kept quiet. I see. We will get some tanbark
down outside. <i>Street Cries Prohibited!</i> and so
on. But how are you getting along generally, old
thing? How are all your organs? Fairly <i>crescendo</i>,
I trust.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leave my organs alone, curse you!&quot; growled
the invalid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Timothy soothingly. &quot;Organs
<i>and</i> Street Cries Prohibited! We'll have a notice
to that effect pinned up on your bedroom door. It
will please Falconer. By the way, how is&mdash;er,
Miss Falconer, this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
Thereafter the conversation pursued a line far
remote from Philip's health. Needless to say, the
impressionable Timothy had fallen an instantaneous
victim to Peggy. Striding about the room,
absently munching some grapes which he had
brought as a present for Philip, Timothy embarked
upon a whole-hearted panegyric of his present
adored one, heedless of the fact that the same panegyric
had been delivered, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to the
same audience by the same rhapsodist many times
before.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip lay back and listened contentedly&mdash;nay,
approvingly. He experienced no feeling of jealousy.
No man, he considered, could know Peggy
Falconer without loving her, so why blame Timothy?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you noticed the neat little way she puts
her head on one side, and smiles right up at you,
when she wants something done that you don't
want to do?&quot; enquired the infatuated youth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What sort of thing?&quot; asked Philip, glad to discuss
Peggy in any aspect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, going away, and things like that,&quot; said
Timothy, naïvely. &quot;And her complexion, and her
arms&mdash;my word! Have you seen her in evening
kit? Fancy you knowing her when you were kids!
I suppose you were great pals?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare say,&quot; admitted the reticent Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only in a childish sort of way, though, I suppose?&quot;
pursued Timothy, with a touch of anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">Before his suspicions could be allayed there came
a vigorous but rhythmatic tattoo played upon the
tiny brass knocker of the door.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Tum-ti-tum-ti-tiddle-i-um, Tum-ti-tum-ti-tum-tum!<br />
Officers' Wives getting pudding and pies,<br />
Soldiers' Wives get skilly!</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">it said. This was Peggy's regulation way of announcing
to her patient that she was about to enter
the room. When her hands were full she whistled
it. Philip knew every beat of it by heart.</p>

<p class="indent">After the usual brief interval the door opened
and Peggy entered, to announce to Timothy, with
her head upon one side in the manner which he had
just described with so much tenderness and enthusiasm,
that it was time for him to depart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have another visitor,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">The newcomer proved to be a gigantic Scotswoman,
of forty or more, with humorous blue eyes
and a slow, comprehending smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is Miss Leslie, Philip,&quot; announced Peggy.
&quot;Mr. Rendle, I want to show you our front door.
The exterior is greatly admired.&quot;</p>

<p class="h3">III</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie sat down in the chair vacated by
Timothy, and remarked, in a soft Highland
drawl: &quot;It is very shocking, being left alone with a
young man like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled, and Philip's heart warmed to her at
once. He felt instinctively that Miss Leslie was
going to be a less bewildering companion than Miss
Babs Duncombe, for instance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My only excuse for my unmaidenly conduct,&quot;
continued the visitor, &quot;is that I am a very old
friend of Peggy's. I have known her ever since she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
was so high.&quot; She indicated Peggy's infant stature
by a gesture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So have I,&quot; said Philip proudly. &quot;Did you
know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No, Miss Leslie did not know: Peggy had not
told her; so Philip, with wonderful fluency for him,
explained the circumstances under which he had
first entered the house of Falconer.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie chuckled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be a fine ploy for Montagu,&quot; she said,
&quot;scarifying a little boy. But I am glad you met
Peggy's mother, if only for five minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was very kind to me during those five
minutes,&quot; remarked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was my greatest friend,&quot; said Miss Leslie
simply. &quot;But she has been dead for seven years
now. I suppose you knew that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip nodded: Peggy had told him.</p>

<p class="indent">So the conversation proceeded comfortably,
understandingly. Jean Leslie was one of those
women in whose presence a man can put his soul
into carpet-slippers. It was not necessary to select
light topics or invent small-talk for her benefit. She
appeared to know all about Philip, and the Brake,
and the accident. She also gave Philip a good deal
of fresh information about Peggy and her father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hoped,&quot; she said, &quot;that when Montagu was
made an A.R.A. he would be less of a bear. But
he is just the same. Success came too late, poor
body. He is as morose and pernickety and feckless
as ever. Peggy is hard put to it sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect you help her a good deal,&quot; remarked
Philip, with sudden intuition.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
Miss Leslie smiled grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;I put my oar in occasionally.
Montagu dislikes me, I am sorry to say. He is not
afraid of Peggy,&mdash;nor she of him, for that matter,&mdash;but
she is too soft with him: so whenever I see her
overdriven I just step in and get myself disliked a
little more. But he usually comes to me when he is
in trouble, for all that. I am the only person who
has any patience with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After that they talked about London, and
Philip's work, and the future of automobilism.
Miss Leslie apparently saw nothing either &quot;pathetic&quot;
or &quot;quaint&quot; or &quot;tragic&quot; in a man liking to
talk about what interested him. At any rate, she
drew him out and lured him on. For all her spinsterhood,
Jean Leslie knew something of masculine
nature. She knew that the shortest way to the
heart of that self-centred creature Man is to let him
talk about himself, and his work, and his ambitions.
So Philip discoursed, with all his shyness and
reticence thawed out of him, upon subjects which
must have made his visitor's head ache, but which
won her heart none the less. That is the way of a
woman. She values the post of confidante so
highly that she will endure a man's most uninteresting
confidences with joy, because of the real
compliment implied by their bestowal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am a silly sentimental old wife,&quot; she mused to
herself afterwards, &quot;but it warmed my heart to
have that boy turning to me for advice on things I
knew nothing about. It would be good for him, too.
He would never talk like that to Peggy; he would
be afraid of wearying her. I do not matter.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE INARTICULATE KNIGHT</p>

<p class="h3">I</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Philip</span> departed from Tite Street, Chelsea,
without having invited Peggy to go with him.
Getting married, except in the case of the very
young, is not such a simple business as it appears.
The difficulty lies in the fact that a man's conception
of the proper method of wooing is diametrically
opposed to that of a maid; and since the maid
has the final word in the matter, it stands to reason
that the campaign must ultimately be conducted
upon her lines and not her swain's. Hence Romeo
usually finds himself compelled, at the very outset,
to abandon a great many preconceived and cherished
theories, and adapt himself to entirely unfamiliar
conditions of warfare, and he usually suffers
a good deal in the process.</p>

<p class="indent">On paper, the contest should be of the most one-sided
description; for the defending force (as represented
by the lady) is at liberty to choose its own
ground and precipitate or ward off an assault as it
pleases, while the invader has to man&oelig;uvre clumsily
and self-consciously in the open, exposed to
shafts of ridicule, fiery days of humiliation, and
frosty nights of indifference. He marches and
countermarches, feeling sometimes tender, sometimes
fierce, not seldom ridiculous; but never,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
never, never sure of his ground. Truly it is a one-sided
business&mdash;on paper. But woman has no
regard for paper. Under the operation of a mysterious
but merciful law of nature, it is her habit,
having placed herself in an absolutely impregnable
position, to abandon her defences without warning
or explanation&mdash;not infrequently, at the moment
when the dispirited lover at her gates is upon the
point of striking camp and beating a melancholy
retreat, marching out, bag and baggage, into the
arms of her dazed and incredulous opponent.</p>

<p class="indent">But Philip, being unversed in the feminine instinct
of self-defence, did not know this. To him,
from a distance, Love had appeared as a Palace
Beautiful standing on the summit of a hill&mdash;a
fairy fabric of gleaming minarets, slender lines, and
soft curves&mdash;a haven greatly to be desired by a
lonely pilgrim. Now that he had scaled the height
and reached his destination he found nothing but
frowning battlements and blank walls. In other
words, he had overlooked the difference between
arrival and admission. To sum up the situation in
the language which would undoubtedly have been
employed by that master of terse phraseology, Mr.
Timothy Rendle, Philip was &quot;up against it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There is nothing quite so impregnable as the reserve
of a nice-minded girl. The coquette and the
sentimental miss are easy game: there is never any
doubt as to what they expect of a man; and man,
being man, sees to it that they are not disappointed.
But to make successful love to a girl who is neither
of these things calls for some powers of intuition and
a thick skin. It is the latter priceless qualification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
which usually pulls a man through. Philip possessed
rather less than the average male equipment
of intuition, and his skin was deplorably thin.
Peggy meant so much to him that he shrank from
putting everything to the touch at once. Like all
those who have put all their eggs in one basket, he
feared his fate too much. So he temporised: he hung
back, and waited. If Peggy had ever given him an
opening he would have set his teeth and plunged
into it, blindly and ponderously; but she never did.
She was always kind, always cheerful, always the
best of companions; but she kept steadily to the
surface of things and appeared to be entirely oblivious
of the existence of the suppressed volcano which
sighed and rumbled beneath her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip became acquainted, too, with the minor
troubles of the love-lorn. If a letter lay on Peggy's
plate at breakfast he speculated gloomily as to the
sex of the sender. He sat through conversations in
the course of which his Lady appeared to make a
point of addressing every one present but himself.
He saw what Mr. Kipling calls &quot;Christian kisses&quot;
wasted upon other girls and unresponsive babies.
He would pass from the brief rapture of having his
invitation to a drive in the Park accepted to the
prolonged bitterness of having to take the drive
in company with a third party, casually coöpted
into the expedition by Peggy at the last moment.
He purchased little gifts, and kept them for days,
not venturing to offer them for fear of a rebuff. Once
or twice he embarked upon carefully prepared conversational
openings of an intimate character, only
to have these same caught up, tossed about, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
set aside with unfeeling frivolity by the lady to
whom they were addressed. He sometimes wondered
what had become of the Pegs he had once
known&mdash;the wistful, dreamy, confiding little girl
with whom he had discussed all things in heaven
and earth under the wintry skies of Hampstead
Heath. Mental myopia is a common characteristic
of young men in Philip's condition.</p>

<p class="indent">So he departed from Tite Street without having
delivered himself, and returned to his own place.
And yet not even that. For the garret in Wigmore
Street was no more. One day during his convalescence
he had desired certain books and papers, so
Peggy and Miss Leslie made an expedition to fetch
them.</p>

<p class="indent">They drove up to the door of the house, and
having ascended to the fourth floor, let themselves
into Philip's retreat with his latchkey.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is terribly thrilling,&quot; observed the romantic
Miss Leslie, &quot;to find yourself alone in a man's
rooms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy said nothing, but looked round the dusty
sitting-room with wondering eyes. She thought of
her own private den at home, with its pretty
curtains, soft cushions, fresh flowers, and the
thousand useless but companionable knick-knacks
that make a woman's room look cosy. This gaunt,
pictureless, carpetless eyrie made her shiver.
There was not even a grate in the fireplace: only a
rusty gas-stove.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy on us!&quot; exclaimed Miss Leslie. &quot;Can
the man not afford a cover for the table? And
where does he sit if a visitor comes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
She disappeared into Philip's bedroom, and
returned dragging a portmanteau.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The only chair in there has a leg missing,&quot; she
mentioned. &quot;Take the armchair, child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy obeyed, and Miss Leslie, seating herself
cautiously upon the portmanteau, enquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How long has the creature been living here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two or three years, I think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has he no friends?&quot; continued Miss Leslie
scathingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know, I am sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No mother, of course?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have always maintained,&quot; she observed,
&quot;that there ought to be a law appointing women
inspectors to go round and look after the rooms
of young men that live alone in London. Their
motives would be misunderstood, of course, but it
would be worth while, all the same. Is there a
servant-body of any kind in this place?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He says that a woman comes in every morning
and tidies up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to meet her,&quot; said Miss Leslie
grimly. &quot;I expect she could a tale unfold. Where
does he get his food, and how does he eat it? Off
the floor?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Peggy, who had sat very
silent through this tirade. &quot;I&mdash;I had no idea
it was as bad as this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They invaded the tiny pantry. Here they found
a teapot, together with a cup and saucer, two
plates, a knife, a fork, and a spoon. There was also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
a small frying-pan, and a tarnished cruet-stand.
A very dingy dishcloth hung upon a nail at the
back of the door. There were receptacles which
had evidently at one time contained tea, sugar,
and salt, but they were empty. The lady who
tidied up had seen to that. The place was dusty,
and smelt of mice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he told me only yesterday that he was
very happy here,&quot; remarked Miss Leslie. &quot;Poor,
poor body!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They returned to the sitting-room, and, having
selected the necessary books from a heap upon the
floor, turned to go. But Miss Leslie's attention
was arrested by something upon the mantel-piece.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bless me,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;what's that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&quot; was the Meldrum Carburettor, the original
model&mdash;the solitary ornament of the apartment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He invented it, I think,&quot; said Peggy. &quot;Didn't
he tell you about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He did,&quot; replied Miss Leslie, &quot;several times.
Well, let us be stepping. This place gives me the
creepies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She marched out of the room and began to
descend the staircase. Peggy, hanging back for a
moment, unexpectedly produced a diminutive
pocket-handkerchief from her belt, and put it
furtively to one of its uses.</p>

<p class="indent">After that, flinging a defiant glance round the
empty room, she picked up the books from the
table and turned once more to the door. Suddenly
her eye was caught by a gleam of colour at her
feet. It was a pink carnation&mdash;one of a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
bunch which Philip had given to her. He had
bought them in the street during his first outing
in a bath-chair, and after keeping them for three
days had taken the flowers in one hand and his
courage in the other and made the presentation.
They were slightly faded&mdash;a fact upon which their
recipient had not failed to comment. Indeed, she
had accused the donor, to his great distress, of
having bought them second-hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, here was one of the bunch lying on the
dusty floor: Peggy had dislodged it from her belt
in replacing her handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">She picked it up, and gazed thoughtfully about
the room. Then she tiptoed across to the mantelpiece,
and proceeded to ornament the Meldrum
Carburettor with a floral device. Then she ran
guiltily down stairs after Miss Leslie.</p>

<p class="h3">II</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philip,&quot; enquired Miss Falconer of her patient
that evening, &quot;how much money have you got?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip ruminated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't quite know,&quot; he said. &quot;How much
do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want enough to find decent rooms for you to
live in. Can you afford it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose so. I don't spend half my income at
present. My father left me a good deal, and I
have my salary as well. But what is the matter
with my present abode?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is poky, and dirty, and unfurnished, and
quite impossible,&quot; said Peggy with finality. &quot;You
must move into something better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
&quot;The rooms suited me well enough,&quot; objected
Philip. &quot;I got through a good lot of work there.
Besides, they were handy for Oxford Street.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, you will leave them,&quot; announced
Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip glowed comfortably. He liked being
ordered about by his Lady. It showed that she
took more than a passing interest in him, he argued.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I do,&quot; he said cunningly, &quot;will you come and
see me there sometimes? Tea, or something? You
could bring Miss Leslie,&quot; he added.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mayhap,&quot; replied Peggy indulgently. &quot;But
listen: I have a plan. I think you and Tim Rendle
ought to take rooms together. At present he is in
a very stupid, expensive set of chambers in Park
Place, wasting a lot of money and getting into bad
habits. You could club together and take a lovely
little flat, say in Knightsbridge, and have a proper
servant and decent meals. Will you? Philip, what
are you frowning about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip's little glow of happiness had died away
as suddenly as it came. That Peggy should make
plans for his future was gratifying enough. But
to be urged by one's Best Beloved to set up a
permanent bachelor establishment is not an unmixed
delight. Such a recommendation points in
the wrong direction. Philip would have been better
pleased had Peggy advised him to take a real
house somewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides, the mention of Timothy had spoiled
everything. Not that Philip was jealous, but
Timothy's inclusion in the scheme had shorn the
situation of its romance at a single blow. For one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
foolish moment Philip had imagined that Peggy's
concern for his welfare and comfort had their
roots in deep soil; but now the whole enterprise
stood revealed for what it was&mdash;a mere feminine
plot: a piece of maternal officiousness. Timothy
and Philip were to be put into chambers together&mdash;Timothy
to brighten up that dull dog Philip,
and Philip to act as a check upon that irresponsible
young idiot Timothy. Hence the ungracious
frown. But his spoken objections took a different
line.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Knightsbridge is a long way from Oxford
Street,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know,&quot; replied Peggy calmly. &quot;That is why
I chose it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tim would rather interfere with my work,&quot;
Philip continued.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know,&quot; repeated Peggy. &quot;That is why I
chose <i>him</i>! He will be a nice distraction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will,&quot; growled Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Peggy flared up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philip,&quot; she asked hotly, &quot;why are you so
cross? Don't you like Timothy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course, I do; but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And wouldn't it be pleasant to have his
company?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, rather! But&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip reddened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said helplessly. But he
knew well enough, and so did Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then don't be a baby,&quot; she said severely.
&quot;It is not very nice of you, considering that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
I am only trying to make you comfortable
and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Philip was already doing penance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy,&quot; he burst out,&mdash;he called her Peggy
because she called him Philip: they had never
returned to &quot;Pegs&quot; and &quot;Phil,&quot; although she
sometimes addressed him as &quot;Theophilus,&quot;&mdash;&quot;I
am a brute. Forgive me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy relented, and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you are not a brute,&quot; she said; &quot;you are
just a child. However, since you are an invalid,
I forgive you. But you must not be sulky when
people take trouble on your behalf. You are getting
a big boy now, you know! Say 'thank you,'
nicely!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Philip obediently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is <i>much</i> better,&quot; remarked Peggy approvingly.
&quot;But tell me, why don't you want to settle
down in nice comfy rooms with Tim?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip hesitated, and his throat went dry. Was
this his opening&mdash;at last?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't want to settle down&mdash;in that way,&quot;
he said hoarsely. &quot;Peggy, I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I tell you why?&quot; interposed Peggy.
&quot;Because you are far too much wrapped up in your
work. You work too hard. You think of nothing
but Oxford Street and&mdash;and carburettors, and
things. I want you&mdash;I mean, you ought to go
about more, and see people, and enjoy yourself,
and have a lot of friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't want&mdash;&quot; declared Philip rebelliously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think how interesting and amusing you could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
be, if you went about and met more people,&quot;
continued Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">She got home that time. Philip winced.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm a dull dog, I know,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you are not,&quot; said Peggy; &quot;so don't be
foolish.&quot; Then, softening again, for she had
averted the danger, she continued gently:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All I meant was that it would do you good
to have a little more leisure and distraction. 'All
work and no play,' you know! Now, will you
look about for nice rooms when you get well&mdash;for
yourself and Tim?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;if you will help,&quot; replied Philip, with
great valour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I will,&quot; said Peggy heartily; &quot;but
not if you are going to be cross with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip assured her that she need never again
have any fears upon that score. And he was as
good as his word.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>XXIII</h2>

<p class="h3">MAINLY COMMERCIAL</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as Philip's bodily mechanism would
permit, flat-hunting expeditions were organised,
and eventually resulted in the leasing of an <i>appartement</i>
near Albert Gate. The rooms stood high up,
overlooking the Park, and were described by the
agent and Timothy as &quot;a lovely little bachelor
suite,&quot; and &quot;a self-contained monkey-house&quot; respectively.</p>

<p class="indent">Furnishing followed. One fine morning a party
consisting of Peggy, Miss Leslie, Philip, and
Timothy set out to purchase household equipment
of every kind. It was a disastrous expedition.
All four were in a mood for enjoyment, and their
high spirits, as very often happens when the young
of the two sexes combine to transact business
jointly, took the form of helpless, speechless, and
unseemly laughter. If a majestic shop-walker,
addressing the party as a whole, enquired what
he might have the pleasure of showing to them,
every one waited for some one else to reply: then,
after a pause, every one replied at once. An
untimely explosion followed, and the party turned
on its heel and hurried, panic-stricken, into the
street.</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy was at the bottom of the trouble. He
began the day by marching into Harrods's and
ordering a funeral; repudiating the contract, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
ten minutes of ghoulish detail, upon the plea of
having suddenly remembered that the deceased
had expressed a desire to be buried at sea, and
asking instead to be directed to the Canadian
canoe department.</p>

<p class="indent">Later, he conducted his followers to the establishment
of an extremely select and most expensive
bootmaker in St. James's. The whole party
were ushered with much solemnity into an apartment
upon the first floor&mdash;Timothy wearing a
face of intense gravity, Philip in a gentle perspiration,
and Peggy and Miss Leslie dumbly gripping
one another's fingers. The room was plainly but
expensively furnished. Upon a pedestal in one
corner stood a plaster cast of a Royal foot.</p>

<p class="indent">Two serious gentlemen in frock-coats stood
awaiting them. These, after providing chairs and
offering a few observations upon the weather and
the Parliamentary situation, inquired Timothy's
pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want a Wellington boot,&quot; said Timothy.</p>

<p class="indent">The stouter of the two serious gentlemen
touched a bell; whereupon a third gentleman in a
frock-coat appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A pair of hunting-tops,&quot; announced the stout
man.</p>

<p class="indent">The newcomer brought a small stool, and lowering
himself upon knee with knightly grace, began
to grope under Timothy's chair for one of Timothy's
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not for myself,&quot; explained Timothy. &quot;For a
grand-uncle of mine&mdash;Lieutenant-Colonel Busby,
of the Indian Army.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
&quot;If the Colonel,&quot; suggested the senior frock-coat
deferentially, &quot;would favour us with a call,
we could measure him for a pair more satis&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a pair,&quot; corrected Timothy. &quot;I said
just one. My grand-uncle had the misfortune to
lose a leg in Afghanistan in eighteen-sixty-seven,
so naturally he does not require two boots. Besides,
I doubt if he could call on you. He goes out very
seldom now: he is almost bedridden, in fact. All
he wants is a number nine Wellington boot. Have
you got one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The frock-coats conferred in mysterious whispers,
while the two ladies did not cease to cling to
one another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We should be happy to make the boot, sir,&quot;
was the final verdict. &quot;Is it for the right foot or
left?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy's face expressed the utmost dismay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have entirely forgotten,&quot; he said. &quot;It is
unpardonably stupid of me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to the cowering Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cousin Theophilus,&quot; he said, &quot;can you recollect
which leg it was that Uncle Hannibal lost?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The right, I think,&quot; said Philip hoarsely.
&quot;Not sure, though. Don't rely on me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tim turned to Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cousin Geraldine?&quot; he enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The left, I believe,&quot; replied Peggy composedly.</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy gave a perplexed smile, and turned to
Miss Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must leave it with you to decide, Aunt
Keziah,&quot; he said. &quot;What have you to say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honk, honk honk!&quot; replied Aunt Keziah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
wildly. Timothy rose to his feet, and smiled
apologetically upon the gentlemen in frock-coats.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear,&quot; he said, &quot;that there is nothing for it
but to go home and look. Good-morning!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">After two hours of this sort of imbecility the
troupe found itself consuming ices in Bond Street,
having become possessed so far of two bath-mats
and a waste-paper basket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now we must be serious,&quot; announced Miss
Leslie, wiping her eyes. She had learned to her
cost this morning that no woman is ever too old
to be immune from a fit of the giggles. &quot;Mr.
Rendle, will you kindly go home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy's only reply was to dash out of the
tea-shop and into an optician's on the other side of
the street. Presently he returned, putting something
in his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fall in and follow me!&quot; he commanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are we going to?&quot; enquired Peggy, as
the expedition meekly complied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;International Furniture Company,&quot; was the
brisk reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy's dupes regarded one another more
hopefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That sounds like business,&quot; said Philip.
&quot;Come along!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Timothy's exuberance was not yet exhausted.
On approaching the stately premises of
the International Furniture Company he suddenly
produced a pair of tinted spectacles from his
pocket and put them on. Then, assuming the
piping voice and humped shoulders of doddering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
senility, he took the scandalised Miss Leslie by the
arm, and limping through the great doorway of
the shop, demanded the immediate presence of the
manager of the Antique Furniture Department.</p>

<p class="indent">On the appearance of that functionary, Tim
bade him a courtly good-morning, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I desire first of all to inspect your dining-room
suites. We are setting this young couple&quot;&mdash;indicating
Philip, who flushed crimson, and Peggy, who
exhibited no confusion whatever&mdash;&quot;up in a flat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The manager, a short-sighted young man with
a nervous manner, after a startled inspection of
the decrepit figure before him, turned upon his
heel and led the way to the dining-room suites.
Timothy hobbled after, leaning heavily upon
Miss Leslie's arm and coughing asthmatically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tim, you young ass,&quot; urged Philip, hot with
shame on Peggy's account, &quot;dry up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The relentless humourist took not the slightest
notice. Instead, he addressed the back of the
manager.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The young folk!&quot; he wheezed&mdash;&quot;the young
folk! The old story! The time comes when they
must leave the nest. My little bird&quot;&mdash;here he
laid a palsied hand upon the shoulder of Peggy,
who choked noisily&mdash;&quot;has flown away at last.
It took her a long time to find her wings,&mdash;at one
time I thought she was never going to do it,&mdash;but
all's well that ends well, as Will Shakespeare puts
it. My little bird has found a nest of her own&mdash;with
honest John, here; and damme! her old
grandad is going to furnish it for her! Are these
your dining-room suites? They don't make furniture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
like they did in my young days, when Bob
Chippendale and Nick Sheraton were alive. I
remember&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like this oak table very much,&quot; said Miss
Leslie to Philip, in a high and trembling voice. &quot;I
wonder if there are chairs to match it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But before any business could be transacted the
irrepressible octogenarian was off again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dearest Pamela,&quot; he said affectionately to
Miss Leslie, &quot;how well I remember the day that
we two bought our wedding furniture together!
We made a handsome couple, you and I. You
wore a crinoline, with a black bombazine tippet;
and I was in nankeen overalls and a fob. I was a
mad wag in those days: I remember I offered to
fight the shopman to decide the price of a harpsichord&mdash;or
was it a spinet?&mdash;that I considered
he asked too much for. But times have changed.
I suppose you never fight your customers now to
save chaffering, young man? If you do, all honour
to you! I like to see ancient customs kept up.&quot;
He surveyed the flinching vendor of dining-room
suites with puckered eyes. &quot;I am an old fellow
now, and I fear I would hardly give you full measure.
But if you have any inclination for a bout
with the mufflers,&quot;&mdash;a relentless hand descended
upon the fermenting Philip and drew him forward,&mdash;&quot;my
son-in-law here, honest John&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the manager, murmuring something inarticulate
about a telephone-call, turned tail and fled,
his place being taken by a man of more enduring
fibre.</p>

<p class="indent">And so on.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
They got home about six, having purchased an
imitation walnut wardrobe which they did not
want.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We simply <i>had</i> to buy something after all
that,&quot; said honest John.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">A week later the flat was sufficiently furnished
to be habitable, and the new tenants moved in.</p>

<p class="indent">It was about this time that Philip began to
realise the portent and significance of a mysterious
female figure, resembling an elderly and
intensely respectable spectre, which had been
dogging his footsteps and standing meekly aside
for him upon staircases ever since he entered into
possession. With the arrival of the furniture the
apparition materialised into a diminutive and
sprightly dame in a black bonnet, who introduced
herself as Mrs. Grice, and asked that she and her
husband might be employed as the personal attendants
of Philip and Tim. The pair resided in some
subterranean retreat in the basement, and their
services, it appeared, were at the disposal of such
of the tenants of the building as possessed no
domestic staff of their own. Mrs. Grice could cook,
darn, scrub, and dust; while Mr. Grice (whose
impeccability might be gauged from the fact that
he suffered slightly from gout and possessed a
dress-suit) could wait at table and act as valet to
the gentlemen.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip was alone when the assault was delivered,
and capitulated at once, a natural inclination to
wait until he had consulted Peggy being overridden
by constitutional inability to say &quot;No&quot; to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
a lady. The bargain concluded, Mrs. Grice
advanced briskly to practical details.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, sir,&quot; she said, &quot;I see you 'ave your
furniture comin' in. And very nice furniture, too,&quot;
she added encouragingly. &quot;But if you'll allow me,
I should like to consult you about the fixtures. I
always likes to be businesslike with my gentlemen.
There's that curtain-pole over the window. That
was given me by Sir Percy Peck, the gentleman
what had the flat last. He said to me, just as he
was leaving,&mdash;he was leaving to be married to
Lady Ader Evings, and they sent me a pink ticket
for the wedding, but I couldn't go, what with my
daughter losing 'er 'usband about that time and
Grice getting one of his legs, so it was wasted, not
bein' transferable&mdash;well, he says to me, says Sir
Percy: 'That curtain-pole is a present from me to
you, Mrs. Grice.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The recipient of the departed Sir Percy's bounty
paused to inhale a large quantity of sorely needed
breath. Philip, who had written out a cheque only
two days previously for all the fixtures in the flat,
waited meekly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, sir,&quot; continued Mrs. Grice briskly,
&quot;what shall I do with that curtain-pole? Shall I
'ave it took down, or would it be any convenience
to you to buy it from me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have an idea, Mrs. Grice,&quot; said Philip,
plucking up courage, &quot;that I took over all the
fixtures from the landlord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right, sir, <i>quite</i> right!&quot; assented Mrs. Grice
promptly. &quot;But those were landlord's fixtures.
I'm talking about tenant's fixtures. I dare say,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
she added indulgently, &quot;that you didn't know
about them. Perhaps you haven't taken a flat
before. Well, Sir Percy, he says to me: 'That
curtain-pole is a present from me to you, Mrs.
Grice.' Now, sir, will you have that pole took
down, or will you take it off me 'ands?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After all,&quot; argued Philip to himself, &quot;I daresay
the old lady needs the money more than I do;
and in any case she appears to think the rotten
thing is hers, which will mean my getting another;
so&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly I will take it, Mrs. Grice,&quot; he said.
&quot;Er&mdash;how much do you want for it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the mention of money Mrs. Grice became
greatly flustered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, sir, I would rather leave it to you,&quot; she
protested. &quot;A gentleman knows more about such
things than what I do. I am quite sure you will
give me a fair price for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, feeling perfectly certain that he would
not, again pressed Mrs. Grice to name a figure.
Finally the old lady overcame her extreme delicacy
of feeling sufficiently to suggest ten shillings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we must be fair about it, sir,&quot; she insisted.
&quot;I don't want to overcharge you.&quot; She paused, as
if struck by a sudden thought. &quot;I'll tell you what,
sir,&mdash;we'll ask a third party!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Next moment Mrs. Grice was at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grice!&quot; she called shrilly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Commin', Emmer,&quot; replied a husky voice, and
Mr. Grice sidled into the room with uncanny
suddenness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much, Grice,&quot; enquired his helpmeet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
pointing to the curtain-pole, &quot;would you think
was a fair price for that pole? A <i>fair</i> price, mind!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Grice fixed his wandering and watery eyes
upon the article under consideration, and ruminated.
Finally:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ten shillin',&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Grice turned to Philip with a smile of
delighted surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I declare!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I was
about right, after all, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, quite overwhelmed by this convincing
coincidence of judgment, announced humbly that
he would take the curtain-pole.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had better pay for it now,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One moment, sir, if you please!&quot; replied Mrs.
Grice.</p>

<p class="indent">Darting out on to the landing she reappeared
almost instantly, heralded by a sonorous clang,
carrying a bedroom ewer and basin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now these things, sir,&quot; she announced, &quot;belongs
to Grice. They were Sir Percy's present to
him. 'Grice,' he said, just as he was leaving to
marry Lady Ader Evings, 'this jug and basin are
yours now: they are my present from me to you.'
Didn't he, Grice?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Grice was understood to mumble assent.
Mrs. Grice took another breath. It is hardly
necessary to add that within the next thirty seconds
Philip had become the reluctant owner of a chipped
jug and basin, recently the property of a baronet.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Grice swept on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, sir,&quot; she continued, with unabated
vigour, &quot;these fire-irons&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
But at this moment, to Philip's unspeakable
relief, Timothy arrived, and took command of the
situation at once. Philip put on his hat and went
for a walk in the Park.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We had great fun,&quot; reported Timothy on his
return. &quot;The last thing she tried to sell me was the
fireplace. (I think it was Sir Percy's parting gift
to the cat.) I said that I had no money and that
they had better take it away. That spiked her
guns. And now, my lad, you are going to put on
your best duds and come poodle-faking with me!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXIV" id="XXIV"></a>XXIV</h2>

<p class="h3">LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> enterprise thus mysteriously designated
turned out to be nothing worse than an afternoon
reception, and was the first of many.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, remembering why Peggy had sent him
to live with Tim, began conscientiously to school
himself to the rigours of a society life. He went
everywhere and flinched at nothing. He learned
to converse with the modern <i>ingénue</i> without
feeling like an infant of five; he learned to endure
the cross-examination of dowagers without looking
as if his one idea was to bolt. He went to balls and
crushes. He was introduced to Ranelagh, and
became acquainted with mixed foursomes.</p>

<p class="indent">He did the thing thoroughly. It was all a means
to an end, he felt. He was a dull dog: he had no
parlour tricks. In Peggy's eyes, although in her
kindness of heart she endeavoured to conceal the
fact, he was only Most Excellent Theophilus, a
worthy person. Ergo, he must overcome these
defects in his character and then try his luck
again. So he attached himself to that admitted
social luminary, Tim Rendle, as a humble disciple,
acquiring merit by abandoning some of his favourite
recreations and going out at night when he
would rather have been in bed.</p>

<p class="indent">It was an ingenuous and characteristic method
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
of procedure, and it puzzled Peggy more than a
little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are becoming quite a butterfly, Theophilus,&quot;
she said to him one day. &quot;I thought you
did not like gadding about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Neither I do, very much,&quot; confessed Philip.
&quot;Excepting, of course, when&mdash;except at such
times as&mdash;well, <i>now</i>, in fact!&quot; he concluded
bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent">They were walking along the Chelsea Embankment
together on their way to the new flat,&mdash;completely
equipped at last,&mdash;where Peggy and
Miss Leslie were to be entertained at a great
housewarming tea-party. It was the first time
that they had been alone together for nearly a
month.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, kind sir,&quot; replied Peggy, with a
gracious inclination of her head. &quot;But why don't
you like it? Isn't it pleasant to go out somewhere
after a hard, dull day, and meet your friends, and
talk about things that don't matter, and forget
all about Oxford Street?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; agreed Philip, &quot;I suppose it is. I will
confess this much: I know I should hate to go
back to my old life at Wigmore Street now. I have
widened out to that extent. But the worst of these
social functions is that you have to put in a terrible
lot of spadework before you get down to what you
came out for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean supper?&quot; suggested Peggy, with
intentional flippancy. She found it difficult to
control Philip's movements in conversation. He
had no small talk. Introduce him to a topic, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
five minutes he had brushed aside the flimsy superficialities
to which we are content to confine ourselves
in our social encounters, and was digging
heavily at the fundamental root of the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not supper,&quot; replied Philip gravely. &quot;I
mean this. A man usually regards these gatherings
as a means to an end. He doesn't turn out after
a hard day's work, to stand wedged in a hot room
for hours on end, just because he likes it. He does
not want to meet a chattering mob in the least.
But he does want to meet one particular person
very much, indeed; and perhaps the only way in
which he can achieve his object is by plunging
into a crowded room and talking to fifty bores
first. It seems a terrible waste of energy,&mdash;like
installing an entire electric light plant to illuminate
one globe,&mdash;but sometimes it is the only
way. And usually it is worth it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He paused, feeling a little surprised at himself.
He could never have talked like this to Peggy a
few months ago. Peggy said nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I often wonder,&quot; continued Philip presently,
&quot;when I find myself at one of these entertainments,
how many of the men there have come because
they like it and how many have come simply in the
hope of encountering one particular pair of bright
eyes. Women, I suppose, go because they really
do enjoy it&mdash;the dresses, and the gaiety, and the
opportunity to sparkle, and because it is the right
house to be seen at&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not always,&quot; said Peggy. &quot;But why do <i>you</i>
go, Philip?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She repented of the question the moment she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
asked it, but Philip, who had planned the lines of
this conversation months beforehand, and was not
nearly nimble enough to take advantage of unexpected
short cuts, blundered straight on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I go,&quot; he said frankly, &quot;to try and get polished
up a bit. I think I confessed to you once before
that I was a pretty dull dog. I'm trying to cure
that. So I go out tea-fighting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And all the time you would rather be at home
with your feet on the mantelpiece?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not necessarily. Supposing, as I sat with my
feet on the mantelpiece, that some one&mdash;some
one particular&mdash;came into the room and tapped
me on the shoulder, and said: 'Now then, wake
up! I have a new frock on, and I want you to take
me out somewhere where I can show it off'&mdash;Well,
that would make all the difference in the world.
I&mdash;I should be proud to go, then!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These words were spoken hurriedly and awkwardly,
for Philip's heart was beating furiously.
He was getting near the climax of this laboriously
engineered conversation, and it seemed almost
too much to hope that he would be permitted to
deliver the grand attack without being headed off.
But he certainly was not prepared for Peggy's
next remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see. Well, Theophilus, there is nothing else
for it: we must find you a wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was said quite deliberately, and needless to
say, it entirely disorganised Philip's plan of campaign.
With a sudden cold shock he realised that
the conversation had taken another short cut, and
that the crisis was upon him before he was ready.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
&quot;You are the sort of man,&quot; continued Peggy, in
the same unruffled voice, &quot;who would get along
better in the world with a wife than without one.
There are two kinds of men who marry, you know.
One likes to make a position and then ask a woman
to come and share it, and the other cannot make
any position at all unless he has got the woman
first. You are the second kind. Now&quot;&mdash;Peggy
bent her brows judicially, like a panel doctor
prescribing for an out-patient&mdash;&quot;do I know of
any one who would suit you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip made a desperate attempt to release his
tongue, which was cleaving to the roof of his
mouth; but before he could do so Peggy had
resumed her discourse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She must be the sort of girl,&quot; she said, &quot;who
likes being killed with kindness; because you are
that sort, Mr. Philip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't all girls like being&mdash;&quot; began Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;not all. There are lots of women who
rather despise kindness in a man. They prefer to
be bullied by him, and regarded as tiresome, inferior
creatures. For some mysterious reason it
helps them to look up to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean to say,&quot; exclaimed that simple-minded
gentleman, Philip Meldrum, &quot;that a woman
would like a man just because&mdash;not although,
mind, but because&mdash;he was a brute to her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Peggy; &quot;it is true enough of some
women. They don't want to be considered, or
studied, or understood: they would rather be
swamped by the man's personality and give up
thinking about themselves altogether.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
&quot;But not all women?&quot; persisted Philip, whose
conception of the sex was trembling on its base.
&quot;Some of them like being considered and studied
and understood, Peggy, don't they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, most of us do,&quot; admitted Peggy,
smiling. &quot;Not that we ever are, poor things!&quot; she
added resignedly.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip saw an opportunity of getting back to
prepared ground again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Peggy,&quot; he began, &quot;wouldn't you like
to be&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be understood? Yes, indeed! Do you want
me to practise on, Philip?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip with sudden fire, &quot;I do.
And I want to say this&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy laughed serenely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may study me and consider me as much as
you like, Mr. Theophilus,&quot; she said; &quot;I shall enjoy
it. But you won't ever understand me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would have a thundering good try, all the
same,&quot; replied Philip doggedly. &quot;I understood
you once&mdash;when we were children together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; agreed Peggy more soberly, &quot;I believe
you did. Life was a simpler business then. As we
grow up we grow more complicated&mdash;at least,
women do. But you seem to be very much the
same as when I first met you, Philip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that a compliment?&quot; asked Philip dubiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the greatest compliment I have ever paid
you,&quot; said Peggy, flushing suddenly. &quot;What a
sunset! Look!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They paused, and leaned over the parapet.
The October sun was dropping low, and the turbid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
flood of the Thames had turned to crimson.
Philip glanced at his Lady. The hue of the water
seemed to be faintly reflected in her face.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly something took hold of him&mdash;a
power greater than himself. For once the gift of
tongues was vouchsafed him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right, Peggy,&quot; he broke out. &quot;I
believe I am exactly the same as when I was a
boy; in one thing anyhow; in my views on&quot;&mdash;he
boggled at the word &quot;Love,&quot; and finally continued&mdash;&quot;in
my feelings about the biggest thing
of all. Perhaps it is because I have always been
shy and awkward, and have not sought out adventures
that would correct my illusions. Anyhow,
I am an idealist&mdash;a sentimentalist, if you
like. I believe my father was, too, and even the
knowledge that his ideals were shipwrecked does
not discourage me. In my Utopia the men work
and fight, and take all hard knocks and privations
cheerfully, and run straight and live clean.
They work because they like it, and not simply
to make money. A man may work for fame, too,
if he likes, but not the sort of thing we call fame
nowadays&mdash;titles, and newspaper paragraphs, and
stuff of that kind. If one of my knights achieves
a big thing he is not excited about it: he just
polishes up his armour and goes and does another
big thing, without hanging about until a reporter
turns up. I think the title of knight is the grandest
honour a man can win; and it makes me mad
to-day to see how that title has been stolen from
its proper place and bestowed on men who have
subscribed to party funds, or who happened to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
Mayor when Royalty opened a new waterworks.
My knight is a man who has <i>done</i> things, and
done them for just one reason&mdash;for the joy of
doing them; and who dedicates the glory and
the praise, however great or small, to&quot;&mdash;Philip's
voice dropped suddenly&mdash;&quot;to the honour of his
Lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what is his Lady like?&quot; asked Peggy
softly.</p>

<p class="indent">She knew she ought not to do so. If a maid permits
herself to embark with a young man upon a
romantic discussion, it is sometimes difficult to
prevent the conversation from taking an uncomfortably
personal turn. But for the moment
Philip had carried her off her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Lady?&quot; Philip descended from the clouds
abruptly, and replied: &quot;Well, I think you would
make a very perfect Lady for a knight, Peggy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Rubicon at last! One foot at least was over.
Dumbly he waited for Peggy's next word.</p>

<p class="indent">It came.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; said the girl lightly, &quot;I am
not eligible for such a post. Knights are not for me.
You see, Philip,&quot; she continued hurriedly, avoiding
his eyes, &quot;times have changed. Knights are
too scarce and Ladies are too numerous. There
are about a million women in this country alone
who will have to get along without a knight for
the whole of their lives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But not you,&quot; said Philip eagerly. &quot;Any man
would be proud&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Peggy, &quot;for the compliment.
But perhaps I prefer to be one of that million.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
There are so many things that a woman can do
now which were impossible in the days of chivalry,
that she can live her own life quite happily and
contentedly, knight or no.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's all wrong, all wrong!&quot; cried Philip passionately.
&quot;It's all against every law of God and man!
I won't believe it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wrong or right,&quot; pursued Peggy quietly, &quot;it is
a fact that many a woman nowadays would find
a knight rather&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;an encumbrance.
For instance, I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not you, not you!&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">But Peggy continued relentlessly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If ever I <i>do</i> encounter a man who wants to be
my cavalier&mdash;which is of course extremely
unlikely&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She paused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to say, 'No, no!' or 'Impossible!'&quot;
she pointed out severely.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip summoned up the ghost of a smile, and
Peggy proceeded steadily:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If ever I do meet a would-be Knight, I shall
tell him that I am greatly obliged, but that I have
other things to occupy me, and that I prefer to
remain independent. So it is no use, my romantic
friend,&quot; she concluded with a whimsical smile,
&quot;for you to select me as a suitable helpmeet for
one of your imaginary knights. Now we really
must get along: the other two will be wondering
what has become of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned from the parapet to resume her
walk. But Philip looked her straight in the face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that&mdash;final?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
For a moment they regarded one another
unflinchingly, these two reserved and reticent
people. Then Peggy's eyes fell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said in a subdued voice, &quot;that is
final. So don't go hunting up a knight for me,
Philip.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">When Peggy returned home after the tea-party
she found her parent sitting in front of a dead fire,
wearing his overcoat and a face of resigned suffering.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Dad!&quot; she remarked cheerfully. &quot;Why
have you let the fire go out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is of no consequence,&quot; replied Montagu
Falconer. &quot;I am fairly warm in this overcoat.&quot;
He coughed and shivered. &quot;Are we having any
dinner to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy bit her lip, and kneeling down, began to
coax the remnants of the fire into flame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dinner will be at the usual hour,&quot; she said.
&quot;If you don't put coal on a fire it usually goes out,
doesn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At my time of life and in my state of health,&quot;
replied her amiable parent, &quot;I think I have a
right to expect a certain modicum of comfort and
attention. This room, for instance, might be kept
decently heated, without&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you don't like putting on coal yourself,&quot;
Peggy pointed out, &quot;you can always ring for a
servant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the querulous Montagu blazed up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Servants! Exactly! I am left to the servants!
I have a daughter, a grown-up daughter, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
nominally directs my household. But I am left
to the tender mercies of half-witted domestics, in
order that my daughter may go out to tea&mdash;may
trapese from one scandal-exchange to another!
Do you ever consider me at all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Dad,&mdash;sometimes,&quot; said Peggy, bending
low over the smouldering fire. At the same moment
one of the hot cinders sizzled.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXV" id="XXV"></a>XXV</h2>

<p class="h3">CONFESSIONAL&mdash;MASCULINE AND FEMININE</p>

<p class="h3">I</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, I have one thing to be thankful for;
there might have been another man in the background.
Now we must get back to work. <i>Labor
omnia vincit</i>, my son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Philip to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he continued, less philosophically:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose I had better keep right away from
her. I simply couldn't stand any half-a-loaf sort
of friendship. All the same, I'll keep in the offing,
in case I am wanted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he went back to Oxford Street, and told
himself that work was the salt of life.</p>

<p class="indent">But the spell was broken. <i>Labor omnia vincit</i>
proved to be exactly what Julius Mablethorpe had
said it was&mdash;only half a truth; and Dumps's conclusion
that Love and Work are interdependent
terms was borne out to the letter. Philip worked
as hard as ever&mdash;harder, in fact: never had the
business in Oxford Street been more efficiently conducted&mdash;but
the zest of it all was gone. Without
Peggy&mdash;or prospective Peggy&mdash;the day's work,
which had been a series of absorbingly interesting
enterprises, was now a monotonous round. The
whirr of machinery had been music; now it was
merely an unpleasant noise. To overcome difficulties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
and grapple with emergencies had been a
sheer joy; to do so now was a weariness to the flesh.
Philip could not but recall, as he slogged on, Uncle
Joseph's description of his beloved regiment after
the episode of Vivien:&mdash;<i>The only difference
was that whereas the regiment had formerly been commanded
by a Damascus blade, it was now commanded
by a broomstick.</i> Family history appeared to be
walking in a circle.</p>

<p class="indent">But he had no blame for Peggy. She had never
encouraged him, never led him on, never deliberately
appropriated his services. She had been
infinitely kind to him&mdash;and that was all. If this
hitherto unsuspected hardness in her nature was
a permanent thing; if she was determined to live
her own life and be independent&mdash;well, here was
a unique opportunity for a knight to prove
his metal&mdash;to justify his boast that he could serve
without ulterior motives or hope of reward. If
his Lady had selected another knight in preference
to him, matters would have been different: proper
pride would have driven Philip away. But so
long as Peggy walked alone and unprotected, his
vocation in life was clear and unmistakable.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was an uphill business; until by a fortunate
chance it occurred to those in authority at
Coventry that Philip's abilities were being wasted
upon the mechanical routine of the London Office.
Straightway he was transferred to headquarters,
where he was put in charge of the Design and
Construction Department of the Company&mdash;at
liberty to invent and experiment to his heart's
content.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
Here he felt better. He was relieved of the
constant fear of encountering Peggy, and of the
exasperating effervescence of Tim. He also felt
absolved from any further obligation to cultivate
social graces. So he reverted whole-heartedly to
the realm of Things, determined to eliminate People
from his scheme of life for good and all. Machinery,
as Mr. Mablethorpe had said, might break your
arms and legs, but it left your heart alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, it was a black winter. Extreme tragedy is
the privilege of the very young&mdash;those of riper
years do not hug tragedy to their bosoms; they
know too much about it; and in this respect Philip,
for all his twenty-eight years, was youthful, indeed.
But no human experience is without ultimate
profit. Most of us have to live some portion of our
lives under circumstances which make it necessary
to keep our eyes resolutely averted from the future;
and once we have acquired the courage which this
performance demands,&mdash;and it demands a great
deal,&mdash;we have acquired the most valuable asset
that experience can give us. Any one can be happy
who has no doubts about the future; that is why
children laugh and sing all day; but the man who
can keep a stiff upper lip when there is no confidence
in his heart can fairly count himself one of
those who have graduated with honours in the
school of adversity. During those months Philip
acquired the priceless art of taking life as it came,
and, abandoning the pernicious habit of drawing
upon the bank of the Future,&mdash;his account was
sadly overdrawn there already,&mdash;of living within
the income that the Present supplied to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
True, it was a mere pittance, but he learned to
live on it. Upon such foundations is character
built up.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe summed up the whole situation in
his own fashion, when Philip, in the course
of a week-end visit, had unburdened his soul over
the last whiskey-and-soda on Saturday night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philip, my son, you are learning: your education
is proceeding apace. But it hurts, and you are
puzzled and indignant. But never mind! Hold on,
and things will right themselves. Your sense of
proportion will come to the rescue and pull you
through. I know, old man, I know! I have been
through it all. I wasn't always a dull British
householder with an expanding waistcoat. I have
been young and now I am old&mdash;or perhaps middle-aged&mdash;and
I know! Middle age has its compensations.
When we are young, we alternate between
periods when we feel that there is nothing on earth
that we cannot do and periods when we feel that
there is nothing on earth that we can. Advancing
years bring us a comfortable knowledge of our
own limitations. Though we may not have so
many moments of sheer sublimity&mdash;moments
when we touch the stars&mdash;as the young man, we
have fewer hours of blackness. So carry on, Philip.
Steer by dead reckoning, if necessary: you will
get your bearings in time. This experience will do
you no harm, provided you face it between the
eyes. I know nothing of your little lady friend,
but she does not sound to me like a member of
the third sex. On the contrary, she appears to
be gratifyingly feminine. Her present attitude is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
probably a pose of the moment. They can't help
being made as they are, you know. I fully expect
to find my beloved Dumps suffering from the
effects of some germ or other when she comes home
from abroad next month. That reminds me. In
the spring Dumps is to come out&mdash;not of gaol,
but of the schoolroom, which at eighteen is very
much the same thing&mdash;for ever. The festivities
will include what she calls a Joy-Week in Town.
You had better come and stay with us during that
period, and join me in contracting dyspepsia. In
fact, I have a ukase from my daughter to that
effect. Will you come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip assented, listlessly. Joy-Weeks were not
for him.</p>

<p class="h3">II</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jean Leslie lived in a roomy flat high up
in a tall block of buildings that overlooked the
Thames at Chelsea. The larger of the two rooms
was her studio. Hither fat, sweet-scented, and
rebellious little boys and girls in expensive laces
and ribbons were brought by mothers or nurses;
and after they had been coaxed into smiles by the
arts and blandishments of their hostess,&mdash;and for
all her spinsterhood she excelled in that accomplishment,&mdash;Jean
Leslie painted miniatures of
them, for which their doting and opulent parents
paid fancy prices.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear, you must be very rich,&quot; observed
Peggy one afternoon, inspecting three portraits of
cherubic innocents, recently completed and awaiting
despatch.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
Jean Leslie poured out the tea complacently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said; &quot;I scrape a living. Sit
down and eat something. I have some of your
favourite Valencia buns.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Peggy seemed restless. She wandered round
the little sitting-room, minutely examining photographs
and pictures which she already knew by
heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy Falconer,&quot; enquired Miss Leslie at last,
&quot;will you come and sit down in that chair, or will
I take you by the shoulders and put you there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sorry, dear,&quot; said Peggy; &quot;I have the fidgets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She dropped rather listlessly into a chair, and
then, for no apparent reason, got up and sat in
another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why is my best chair not good enough for
you?&quot; enquired Miss Leslie sternly. &quot;At your
age, you ought not to be man&oelig;uvring to get your
back to the window.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn't that, really,&quot; protested Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It just was,&quot; replied Miss Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">She rose from her seat, and taking the girl by the
elbows, turned her toward the light. Peggy submitted,
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now,&quot; resumed Jean Leslie, sitting down
again, &quot;what is the trouble?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You really are very Early-Victorian, Jean,&quot;
said Peggy severely. &quot;You yearn for sentimental
confidences and heart-to-heart talks. But it's
simply not done now: hearts went out with chignons.
Give me a large and heavy piece of that
muffin, please, and I will pander to your tastes by
talking about Prince Adolphus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
Prince Adolphus was the exalted title of a purely
hypothetical Fairy Personage who was one day
to lead Miss Leslie to the altar. He had been
invented by Miss Leslie herself, and formed a
stock subject of humorous conversation with her
younger friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie said no more, but passed the muffins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How is that boy Timothy?&quot; she enquired.
The mention of Prince Adolphus had brought
Timothy into her thoughts: Timothy had always
expressed profound jealousy of His Royal Highness.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very careworn,&quot; she said. &quot;Since Philip was
sent to Coventry he has been in sole charge at
Oxford Street. By the way, he wants us to lunch
with him on Sunday. Can you manage it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. I am half-expecting a visit from
a fellow countrywoman of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do I know her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I doubt it. Her husband is second engineer on
a liner that plies between London and Melbourne.
She has a good deal of leisure on her hands, poor
soul.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy asked the question that a woman always
asks another in this connection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; replied Miss Leslie; &quot;neither chick nor
child; so when her man has been away for a month
or so, and drinking tea with the wives of other
second engineers in Gravesend begins to pall, she
likes to come round here and crack with me. I
knew her in the old days: her father was head
forester to us. She would be disappointed if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
found me from home. She never tells me when
she is coming: she would regard such a proceeding
as presumptuous. So&quot;&mdash;Miss Leslie sighed resignedly&mdash;&quot;I
just have to stay in for her. Her
husband sailed four weeks ago, and there has
been a hurricane in the Indian Ocean this week; so
I fancy she is about due.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everybody seems to bring their troubles to
you, Jean,&quot; said Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie looked up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Troubles? Oh, no! I assure you, when Eliza
Dishart and I drink tea together, there is no talk of
troubles. We are very grand. We talk about the
Court, and freights, and the possibility of Union
between the Established Kirk and the Free. But
trouble&mdash;oh, dear, no! Once only did we consent
to be informal. That was one wild night in
December two years ago. Half the chimney-pots
in London were flying about in the air, and she
knew that his ship was in the Channel, homeward
bound. She came chapping at my door about ten
o'clock, just as I was going to bed, and asked me if
I would let her sit here for the night. Indeed, I was
very glad of her company. I remember I managed
to pick out the tune of the 'Hymn for Those at
Sea' for her on my piano, and we sang it together.
Very ridiculous we must have looked. We have
never mentioned the occurrence since.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">During this narrative Peggy sat silent and preoccupied.
Finally she said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must be a great relief to be able to unload
your worries on to some one else. A girl has just
been unloading hers on to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
Jean regarded her friend's averted face curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed?&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. A man&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so,&quot; she remarked drily. &quot;She has
presumed too far, and he won't come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy looked up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you are getting romantic again,&quot; she said
reprovingly. &quot;No, it is nothing of the kind. My
friend has had to be rather brutal to a man, and
she feels sorry for him, and she is afraid he must
think rather badly of her&mdash;that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has she been flirting with the poor creature?&quot;
demanded Jean Leslie, in a voice of thunder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. She is not that sort of girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then where does the brutality come in? There
is no brutality in putting a man in his place, provided
you do it in time. As soon as a woman sees
that a man is preparing to fall in love with her&mdash;and
she can usually tell about five minutes after
she has made his acquaintance&mdash;and she doesn't
feel like wanting him, she should get him at arm's
length at <i>once</i>! Have&mdash;has your friend not been
overlong in adopting that precaution?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She couldn't do it before,&quot; explained Peggy,
rather eagerly. &quot;They were thrown together in a
very unusual way. She saw it coming, but could not
do anything to prevent it. And now the man has
gone away; and I'm&mdash;she is sure he thinks&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean Leslie handed her guest a fresh cup of
tea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you certain,&quot; she enquired, &quot;that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
friend of yours <i>wanted</i> to keep the young man at
arm's length?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy twisted her long fingers together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I rather fancy, from what she said, that she
cared for him a bit,&quot; she admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why send him away?&quot; demanded Miss
Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy summoned up a troubled smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear old Jean,&quot; she said, &quot;you are so practical!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Practical? Aye!&quot; replied Jean Leslie grimly.
&quot;If women were a little more practical and a little
less finicky about what they are pleased to call
their hearts, this world would be a more understandable
place to live in. Listen! I had a girl
friend once&mdash;as intimate a friend as yours, I
dare say&mdash;and when the man she wanted asked
her to marry him, she said 'No.' She meant 'Yes,'
of course,&mdash;she merely wanted him to ask her
another half-dozen times or so more,&mdash;but the
stupid man did not understand. He went away,
and married some other body whom he did not
love, just to be quit of thinking about her. Men are
made that way. They will do any daft thing&mdash;take
to drinking or marry another woman&mdash;to
drown the pain of remembrance. But this friend
of mine, being a woman, could not do that. She
just stayed single, and in course of time became
an old maid&mdash;and a practical one, I promise
you! But let us get back to the other girl. Why
did she send her lad away?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because there was some one else whom she
could not leave.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
&quot;A relative?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean Leslie nodded her head slowly and comprehendingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; she said at length. &quot;That is different.
You mean that the relative would have been
helpless without her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Helpless and&mdash;friendless,&quot; said Peggy gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did she tell the young man that that was the
reason?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because&mdash;because I fancy he was the kind
of man who, if he had known the real reason,
would have persisted in staying single on her
account.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why not? Men like that are rare.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, he&mdash;she told me that he was the sort of
man who had no idea of looking after himself, or
making himself comfortable&mdash;the sort of man who
really <i>needed</i> a wife. It would have been cruel not
to let him go. She might have had to keep him
waiting twenty years, and she couldn't bear to
think of him living in discomfort and loneliness all
that time; so&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So she gave him another reason?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What reason?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, the reason a girl usually gives nowadays.
Other interests&mdash;freedom to live one's own life&mdash;and
so on. You know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said Jean Leslie bitterly. &quot;You
need not tell me. I should like to have just five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
minutes' talk, in here, with the man that invented
the higher education of women! However, that
is a digression. Your friend's case, as I have said,
is different. Evidently she is not <i>that</i> sort of girl.
I don't know what advice to give her, poor soul.
She is in deep waters. But you can tell her from
me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes?&quot; said Peggy eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That she is doing the wrong thing&quot;&mdash;Peggy
caught her breath&mdash;&quot;for the right reason. You
can also tell her that she is a brave lass. Perhaps
it may help her a little to be told that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it will,&quot; said Peggy getting up. &quot;Goodbye,
Jean, dearest! I think I will go and tell her
now.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Jean Leslie sat long over the teacups, deep in
thought. Mechanically, she found and lit a cigarette,
and smoked it to the end. Then she lit
another. Darkness had fallen by this time, but
still she sat on, gazing into the glowing fire.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she rose, and turned up the electric
lights. Having done this, she surveyed herself intently
in the mirror over the mantelpiece. For all
her forty-three years she was a youthful woman.
She possessed the white teeth and fair complexion
that Scandinavian ancestry has bequeathed to the
northeastern Highlands of Scotland. Her hair
was abundant, and with a little better dressing
would have looked more abundant still.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned from the mirror with a quaint little
<i>moue</i>, and her eyes fell upon a framed photograph
which stood upon her writing-table. It was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
portrait of Peggy's mother. She picked it up, and
regarded it long and thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank God, Death cannot always close the
account,&quot; she said softly.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, with a resigned sigh and a downward
glance at her comfortable but unfashionable
attire, she seated herself abruptly at the bureau
and wrote a letter to her dressmaker.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXVI" id="XXVI"></a>XXVI</h2>

<p class="h3">THE RIVALS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was five o'clock on a fine spring afternoon.
The model had just resumed his ordinary raiment
and departed, and Montagu Falconer was cleaning
his palette. To him entered a timorous maid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you please, sir, Miss Leslie has called.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is quite possible,&quot; replied Montagu
calmly, &quot;but it does not interest me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she wants to see you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear I cannot oblige her. It is Miss Marguerite's
duty to receive afternoon callers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Marguerite is out, and Miss Leslie
specially asked for you, sir,&quot; persisted the maid,
trembling beneath her employer's cold blue eye.</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu Falconer ruminated for some moments.
Unfortunately he omitted to remove his eye from
the maid, and that sensitive young person was
on the verge of an hysterical yell when he turned
upon his heel and said curtly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask her what the devil she wants.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The maid humbly withdrew. Having closed the
studio door behind her she indulged in a few
grimaces of a heartfelt and satisfying character,
and after pausing to admire herself for a brief
space in a Venetian mirror conveniently adjacent,
returned to the drawing-room, where she took
her stand before Miss Leslie with downcast eyes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
&quot;Mr. Falconer sends his compliments, miss,&quot;
she announced deferentially, &quot;and would be very
much obliged if you could say whether you wanted
him particular, because he is painting a picture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean Leslie smiled. She was wondering what
Montagu really had said. But to the maid she
merely replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the model there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, miss. Models go at five.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then say to Mr. Falconer that I should be
greatly obliged if he could see me for a few minutes,
as I wish to consult him upon an important
matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When the maid had departed, Miss Leslie rose
and walked to the window, through which the
afternoon sun was shining. Peggy's tastes rather
leaned to rose-coloured curtains and silk blinds.
Jean Leslie arranged these to her liking. Then,
having adjusted her hat to the proper angle, she
sat down with her back to the light, and waited.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Montagu entered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Jean,&quot; he said affably,&mdash;he was flattered
by his new rule of consultant,&mdash;&quot;you are
looking very smart to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This testimonial is most gratifying,&quot; said Miss
Leslie. &quot;Do you like my furs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu surveyed her critically. He had a
real eye for form and tone; and he nodded approval.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said; &quot;they suit you perfectly. And
that bunch of violets adds just the right touch of
subdued colour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Miss Leslie meekly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
Montagu sat down on the other side of the
hearth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;However,&quot; he said importantly, &quot;I believe I
am correct in supposing that you did not come
here to show me your clothes.&quot; (In this he was
not so correct as he thought.) &quot;I understand you
wish to have my opinion on some matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miss Leslie. &quot;It is a matter which
I could confide to no one but a very old and very
trustworthy friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so, quite so,&quot; said Montagu, much gratified,
but a little staggered. For the last twenty
years he had rarely encountered the lady before
him for more than five minutes without becoming
embroiled with her in a skirmish of some description;
and pitched battles had been not infrequent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to ask what you <i>think</i>, Montagu,&quot;
continued Miss Leslie. &quot;You are one of the few
people I know whom I would describe as a true
man of the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu Falconer began to purr gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Possibly,&quot; he said&mdash;&quot;possibly! Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fact is,&quot; confessed Miss Leslie, after a
momentary hesitation, &quot;I have received an offer
of marriage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God!&quot; exclaimed Montagu. &quot;Who is
the&quot;&mdash;he was about to say &quot;idiot,&quot; but corrected
himself&mdash;&quot;gentleman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His name,&quot; said Miss Leslie, casting down her
eyes, &quot;is Adolphus Prince. I have known him for
many years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Extraordinary name! Is he old or young?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie considered.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
&quot;He is about fifty,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather elderly,&quot; commented Montagu Falconer,
who was only forty-eight. &quot;How old are
you, by the way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forty-two,&quot; said Miss Leslie coyly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am bound to say, Jean,&quot; remarked Montagu
handsomely, &quot;that you don't look it. Now, what
of this fellow? Is he a gentleman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope so,&quot; said Miss Leslie humbly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But are you <i>sure</i>? You dear women, Jean, if
I may say so, are too apt to be carried away by
your feelings. What is his station&mdash;his position?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is a retired colonel of militia,&quot; replied Miss
Leslie. (This statement would have surprised
Timothy, who would have it that his rival was a
superannuated tea-taster.) &quot;He has lived a great
deal in India, and is now quite alone in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see. One leg and no liver, I presume!&quot; said
Montagu facetiously.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie laughed appreciatively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are as caustic as ever, Montagu,&quot; she said.
&quot;You spare none of us. But what do you think I
should do? I am a solitary woman. It is a dreich
business, living by one's self, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is, it is,&quot; agreed Montagu, lapsing straightway
into self-pity. &quot;Too true! Believe me, Jean,
I know what it means, better than most.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still, you are not entirely alone,&quot; Miss Leslie
reminded him. &quot;You have Peggy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a fact,&quot; admitted Falconer with an air of
gloomy sarcasm, &quot;that I do possess a daughter;
but for all practical purposes I might as well be
Robinson Crusoe. I never see her by day, for I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
am busy in the studio and naturally do not want
to be pestered. In the afternoon, as often as not,
she goes out or invites some people in. In either
case I take my tea alone, for I cannot stand her
associates. When she does go out she frequently
returns only just in time to give me my dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;I had not realised
things from your point of view. It all shows how
little we really know of one another's inner lives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the only nights upon which she ever
seems to stay at home,&quot; concluded the neglected
parent, &quot;are those on which I go out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu was accustomed to go out about five
nights a week, and his daughter perhaps twice a
month; so this statement may have been approximately
correct.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see I have often been thoughtless in my
previous attitude toward you, Montagu,&quot; said the
contrite Miss Leslie. &quot;We women are apt to forget
that a man&mdash;even a strong, self-reliant man&mdash;may
sometimes unbend. He, too, may desire companionship,&mdash;the
right sort of companionship, of
course,&mdash;as much as the weakest woman. Forgive
me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu, highly appreciative of the very proper
spirit displayed by Miss Leslie, forgave her freely,
and then launched into a further catalogue of
grievances, Adolphus Prince retiring for the time
modestly into the background.</p>

<p class="indent">When he had finished, Miss Leslie said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy is young, and perhaps thoughtless.
When she marries&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
Montagu Falconer nearly bounded out of his
chair. He was genuinely alarmed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marry? That child marry? Good God, Jean,
don't suggest such a thing! What would become
of me, I should like to know. What does the girl
want to marry for? Hasn't she got a comfortable
home of her own? Hasn't she got me&mdash;her
father&mdash;her only relation in the world&mdash;to take
care of her? My dear Jean, do not be romantic
at your time of life, I beg of you! You haven't
been putting notions into her head, I hope?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie hastened to still the tempest which
she had created.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How masterful you are, Montagu!&quot; she said.
&quot;I declare, I am quite afraid of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again Montagu purred. In the course of a long
and stormy acquaintance, extending over twenty
or more years, this was the first indication that
he had ever received that Jean Leslie regarded
him with aught else than a blend of amusement
and compassion. A less vain and self-centred
man might have felt a little suspicious of such
sudden and oppressive adulation, but he did not.
Montagu was one of those persons who like flattery
laid on with a trowel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry if I alarmed you,&quot; he said graciously;
&quot;but I feel very strongly upon the subject. I
haven't forgotten the trouble I had in getting
rid of that bargee, Whatsisname&mdash;that chauffeur-fellow!
Curse it! What was he called?&mdash;I have
it&mdash;Meldrum! I foresaw trouble, of course, from
the day upon which my daughter persisted in
dragging his mangled remains into my best bedroom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
instead of sending them to the workhouse.
During his convalescence I had to be perpetually
on guard. The fellow followed her about like an
infernal dog. Once, when I had occasion to reprove
my daughter&mdash;my own daughter!&mdash;for some
fault, he showed his teeth and nearly flew at my
throat! Oh, I had to be pretty firm, I can tell you!
However, I got him out of the house at last, and
I am glad to say that he has not shown his face
here for some months.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like a man to be master in his own house,&quot;
said Miss Leslie approvingly. &quot;I fear my friend
Adolphus Prince has not your strength of character,
Montagu. I wonder if I should be happy with him,&quot; she added musingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He sounds to me,&quot; remarked the courteous
Montagu, &quot;a confirmed and irreclaimable nincompoop.
Has he a weak chest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I wonder how you knew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why marry him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Jean Leslie slowly, &quot;I think I
might be able to help him a little. A lonely man
is a very helpless creature. Not a man like you,
Montagu, but an ordinary man. Such a man lives,
we will say, in chambers or a flat. He may even
have a comfortable house; but he lives alone for
all that. He is at the mercy of servants; when he is
in doubt about anything, he has no one to consult;
when he has done a good piece of work, he has no
one to show it to; when he is out of heart, he has
no one to encourage him. If he wants company,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
he has to go out and look for it, instead of finding
it ready to hand by his own fireside. Altogether,
if he has not your great spirit and resources,
Montagu, he is a very miserable man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The worst of the artistic temperament is that
it is intensely susceptible to the emotion of the
moment. Describe joy, and it becomes hilarious;
describe sorrow, and it becomes tearful; describe
fear, and it becomes panic-stricken. Montagu
Falconer positively shuddered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said quakingly, &quot;that is true&mdash;very
true. And more than that. It is not the weak
man who suffers&mdash;or suffers most. The strong
have their moments of dejection, too, Jean. You
would hardly believe it, but even I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Leslie, like a naughty little girl who is
determined to make her small brother's flesh
creep before he retires to bed, continued remorselessly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what has he to look forward to? Nothing!
Nothing but old age, with its increasing feebleness,
and helplessness, and friendlessness. That is all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked across at the shaking figure in the
armchair, and suddenly there was real pity and
kindness in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to be able to save a man from
that, Montagu,&quot; she remarked gently.</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu nodded his head. For once he had
nothing to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is why,&quot; continued Jean Leslie in the
same even tone, &quot;I am thinking of marrying
Adolphus Prince. I am no longer a girl. I should
understand his moods, which are many: I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span>
manage his house, and I would not be likely&quot;&mdash;she
smiled modestly&mdash;&quot;to go losing my heart to
some younger man after a year or two. And of
course, when I saw that my husband wanted to
be left to himself and not bothered,&mdash;as all husbands
have a right to expect,&mdash;I should have my
painting to occupy me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will say the same for you, Jean,&quot; said Montagu
Falconer almost effusively; &quot;you always had
an appreciation of Art. But come, now! What
of this fellow? Is he a philistine&mdash;a bourgeois&mdash;a
chromolithographer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid poor Adolphus has little knowledge
of Art&mdash;Art as you and I know it,&quot; replied Miss
Leslie regretfully. &quot;But he is a good creature in
other respects.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu Falconer began to walk excitedly
about the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There you are!&quot; he said. &quot;There you are!
Isn't that a woman all over? Here are you, Jean,
with your splendid talents and comparative youth,
with a strongly developed sense of what is right
and beautiful, prepared to throw yourself away
upon a half-pay, knock-kneed, blear-eyed militiaman,
who probably wears Jaeger boots and furnishes
his rooms with stuffed parrots and linoleum.
The idea is unthinkable&mdash;impossible! You cannot
do it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you forbid me to marry him?&quot; said
Miss Leslie timidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly I do,&quot; replied Montagu, noting to
himself with intense gratification that a man has
only to be thoroughly firm with a woman to win
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
her complete submission. &quot;You don't <i>care</i> for the
creature, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not very deeply,&quot; confessed Miss Leslie. &quot;He
is just a friend&mdash;a very old friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed, rose from her seat, and held out her
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye, Montagu,&quot; she said, &quot;and thank
you! I must be going now. It was good of you to
have such a long talk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, don't go yet,&quot; said Montagu. &quot;I
mean&mdash;&quot; He hesitated. He hardly knew what he
did mean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I really must,&quot; replied Miss Leslie.</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu accompanied her silently to the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are going to take my advice, I trust?&quot;
he remarked as they stood upon the steps.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean Leslie pondered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose so,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;A man's
logic and common sense are so invincible. Still,
I owe you a grudge, all the same, for having
deprived me of my one romance. I am not likely
to have another, you see! Good-bye, Montagu,
and thank you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She gave her counsellor a shy but grateful glance,
and departed down the street&mdash;a well-dressed,
well-carried, and well-bred figure.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning Montagu Falconer, after a disturbed
and introspective night, came down to
breakfast at ten o'clock, and dismally surveyed
Tite Street through the dining-room window.
There was a piercing east wind, which penetrated
through every nook and cranny. Peggy had
breakfasted an hour ago.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
Montagu rang the bell for his coffee, and shivered.
He was feeling stiff in the joints this morning:
could it be rheumatism? He would like to consult
some one about this. But of course there was no
one to consult. His daughter, naturally, was not
at her post: she was downstairs ordering dinner, or
something of that kind. Besides, it could not be
rheumatism: rheumatism was an old man's complaint.
Old man! Old men suggested thoughts of
Adolphus Prince. He had some one to consult
about <i>his</i> troubles: he could take them to Jean.
Montagu consigned Adolphus to perdition. Who
was Adolphus Prince, to monopolise&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Next moment Montagu, seized with a sudden
idea, was at the telephone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Number, please?&quot; said a haughty voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want seven-six-seven-one Chelsea, and I'm
in a devil of a hurry,&quot; he replied frantically; &quot;so
put me on as quick&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Br-r-r-r-r-! Ch'k! Number engaged,&quot; announced
the instrument dispassionately.</p>

<p class="indent">Montagu hung up the receiver, and swore. He
was quite panic-stricken by this time. So Adolphus
Prince rang her up at ten o'clock in the morning,
did he? He would show the old dotard who was
the better man!</p>

<p class="indent">Five minutes later he had secured his call, and
was inviting Miss Leslie to lunch with him at the
Ritz.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXVII" id="XXVII"></a>XXVII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE SECOND BEST</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Where</span> shall we go to-night?&quot; enquired the
insatiable Dumps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bed,&quot; replied her exhausted papa, before any
one else could speak.</p>

<p class="indent">The Joy-Week was nearly over. For five days
and nights the newly emancipated Miss Sylvia
Mablethorpe had been allowed a free hand. Each
morning she had conducted her mother relentlessly
to shops. Once or twice her devoted father
had accompanied the expedition, but after being
twice warned by an officious young policeman
for loitering outside a modiste's in Dover Street,
had excused himself from further attendance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are a most amazing sex,&quot; he observed
to Philip. &quot;My precious pair actually spent an
hour and a quarter in a hosiery establishment in
Knightsbridge yesterday morning (into which my
modesty prevented me from accompanying them),
and when they came out neither of them could say
for certain if she had bought anything or not. I
wonder how they do it: if a mere man were to
spend an hour and a quarter in a shop, he would
by the end of that time either be lying dead on the
floor or else equipped with several thousand pairs
of everything. No! Henceforth they shop alone!
I decline to run any further risk of contracting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
flat-foot through standing about on a hard pavement,
or mental prostration from thinking out
topics of conversation suitable to retired heroes
who open carriage doors. To-morrow morning,
Philip, I will give them one shilling each&mdash;they
don't really need so much, for it costs nothing to
have things dragged off high shelves and put back
again; but they will probably require ices or some
other poison about eleven&mdash;and you and I will
get up an appetite for lunch by going for a
ride.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the present moment the party were taking
tea at the Carlton, after a matinée.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it would be nice,&quot; continued Sylvia
in a far-away voice, entirely ignoring her male
parent's suggestion, &quot;if we went to a music-hall.
I haven't been to one yet; and I am getting a bit
tired of theatres.&quot; (Which was not altogether
surprising, considering that Miss Sylvia and suite
had visited seven in five days.) &quot;Then you could
smoke, daddy,&quot; she continued artfully. &quot;You will
come, won't you, Philip?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may possibly have escaped your memory,&quot;
Mr. Mablethorpe mentioned, &quot;that we are engaged
to dine to-night with Derek Rayner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, bother!&quot; said the ungrateful Dumps;
&quot;so we are. Has he invited you, Philip?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Philip; and Mr. and Mrs. Mablethorpe
exchanged glances.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I'll tell you what,&quot; announced Sylvia,
who was not of an age to have any regard for the
feelings of young men; &quot;we will dine with Derek,
and you must join us afterwards, and we will all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
go to the Arena together. I hear it is the best
place. Derek won't mind, will he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sure the arrangement will meet with his
entire approval,&quot; remarked Mr. Mablethorpe
solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case,&quot; continued Sylvia with great
cheerfulness, having gained her point, &quot;we had
better telephone to him that we shall want dinner
earlier. What time do music-halls begin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The performance,&quot; said her father, &quot;is timed
to commence at eight <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, but attendance during
the earlier turns is not compulsory.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke bravely, but without hope, for he
knew his daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I insist,&quot; announced the voracious Dumps,
&quot;on being there when the curtain goes up. I shall
tell Derek that we will dine at a quarter to seven.
Do you think this hotel is on the telephone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Possibly. If not, we can always climb to the
top of the Haymarket and light a beacon-fire,&quot;
replied the caustic Mr. Mablethorpe, still sore at
the thought of yet another scrambled dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">His daughter ignored the pleasantry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you come and help me to find it, Philip?&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip complied, and the pair went out to the
hotel telephone exchange, leaving Mr. and Mrs.
Mablethorpe to regard one another curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Derek!&quot; said Mrs. Mablethorpe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Dumps!&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe, to
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, at the telephone, Sylvia was saying
to Philip:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
&quot;It would never do to leave you out, Philip, on
the last evening, would it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment their eyes met. Then Sylvia's
dropped quickly.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Philip dined in solitary state in his own flat. He
still retained his holding therein, for his duties
involved a good deal of travelling, and it was
convenient to have a <i>pied-à-terre</i> in London.
Timothy was out, and he had the premises to himself,
for which he was not altogether sorry. He had
a good deal to occupy his mind just at present, and
he wanted to think.</p>

<p class="indent">But his thoughts had made no appreciable
progress when he arrived at the Arena Palace of
Varieties at five minutes to eight.</p>

<p class="indent">He found the party already assembled in the
<i>foyer</i>, under the radiant direction of Sylvia and the
thundercloud escort of Mr. Derek Rayner, who
greeted Philip gloomily but politely. A mincing
damsel in a lace tucker conducted them to their
seats, which were situated in the fourth row of an
unpeopled desert of stalls.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's lucky we got here in time,&quot; mused Mr.
Mablethorpe, surveying the Sahara around them.
&quot;We might have had to stand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If people,&quot; remarked Sylvia with asperity,
&quot;think it grand not to come to a heavenly place
like this till ten o'clock, so much the worse for
them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sank down luxuriously in the armchair
which called itself a stall, and commanded Philip
and Rayner to dispose themselves upon either side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
of her, leaving her parents to shift for themselves.
Rayner, with the air of a conjuror who is a little
doubtful as to whether his audience are not getting
slightly tired of this trick, produced a box of
chocolates out of his hat, and the party settled
down to enjoy the performance.</p>

<p class="indent">The ladies and gentlemen who figured in the
earlier portion of the programme were obviously
surprised and pleased to find the stalls inhabited.
Accustomed to shout across an ocean of blue plush
to an audience of pigmies situated upon the distant
horizon, their gratification at finding human
beings within a few yards of them was extreme.
More than one of the comedians worked an allusion
to the fact into his &quot;patter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">About a quarter to nine the ranks of the stallholders
were stiffened by the arrival of a magnificent
gentleman in evening dress, with a gardenia
in his buttonhole. He took a seat in the front row.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told you there would be lots of people soon,&quot;
announced Sylvia.</p>

<p class="indent">But alas! her triumph was premature. Shortly
after the arrival of the gentleman with the gardenia
the drop-curtains ascended upon Turn
Number Five&mdash;Professor Boko, the Man of
Mystery, assisted by a stout lady in mauve tights.
The Professor, speaking with a French accent
which had plainly served an apprenticeship in
New York, opened the proceedings by appealing
to the audience to send up an impartial and unbiased
body of gentlemen upon the stage, to act&mdash;why,
Heaven knows&mdash;as &quot;Committee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You go, dad!&quot; said Sylvia.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span>
&quot;I expect the Man of Mystery has made his
own arrangements,&quot; replied Mr. Mablethorpe.</p>

<p class="indent">And sure enough, almost before he had spoken,
the gentleman with the gardenia left his seat and
scrambled up a pair of plush-covered steps to the
stage.</p>

<p class="indent">He must have repented bitterly of his public-spirited
precipitancy; for instead of being treated
with respect due to a Committee,&mdash;no one else
had come forward,&mdash;he was subjected by the
Professor to a series of humiliating and embarrassing
experiences. Showers of playing-cards were
squeezed from his nose; flapping goldfish were
extracted from his ears; bullets were fired point-blank
into his shirt-front and discovered (by the
lady in tights) in his coat-tail pockets. His silk
hat was turned into a coffee-urn. His very gardenia
was snatched from him and shaken out into
a Union Jack. Still, he maintained a heroic attitude
throughout, smiling woodenly at each successive
outrage, and loudly proclaiming his entire
satisfaction with the genuineness of the performance
before resuming his seat. However, it was
plain that the strain had been too great for him;
for presently he put on his hat, stole quietly away,
and was no more seen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor thing! I wonder where he has gone to,&quot;
said the sympathetic Sylvia.</p>

<p class="indent">Derek Rayner, who was at the age for which the
drama has no secrets, explained that this gentleman
was now probably travelling in the same cab
with the Man of Mystery and the lady in tights to
undergo further humiliations at another music-hall.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
Presently the stalls began to fill up in real earnest,
and turns came thick and fast. Some were
sentimental, some were funny, a few were vulgar,
and some were merely idiotic. Once or twice Mr.
Mablethorpe held his head and said his brain was
going; but on the whole they enjoyed themselves
greatly, especially that unspoiled child of nature,
Miss Sylvia.</p>

<p class="indent">Sylvia was particularly pleased with Mr. Arthur
Mow, Comedian. When that gentleman's number
went up there was a round of applause, and the
orchestra dashed into a merry tune.</p>

<p class="indent">There came a pause. Then the tune was played
again. Then another pause. Slight uneasiness
among the audience.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He hasn't turned up,&quot; remarked the worldly-wise
Rayner. &quot;These chaps do four Halls a night.
He's probably on the other side of London, in a
broken-down taxi.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The band played its prelude once more, and
then some one&mdash;presumably the manager&mdash;appeared
upon the stage and offered an apology for
Mr. Mow's absence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was here a moment ago, ladies and gentlemen,&quot;
he declared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rats!&quot; observed a disappointed lady in the
gallery.</p>

<p class="indent">The manager redoubled his assurances. They
had searched high and low, he said, but could not
find Mr. Mow anywhere. Would the audience&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">His speech was interrupted by the conductor
of the orchestra.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Arfur Mow reelly 'asn't arrived,&quot; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span>
announced, rising to his feet, &quot;I'll give you a turn
meself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And bounding upon the stage, the conductor
turned and faced the audience with a flourish.
He was none other than the missing Arfur Mow!
Having chased his apologist into the wings amid
shouts of delight, the great man proceeded to the
serious work of the evening&mdash;a ditty entitled:&mdash;&quot;A
Glorious Death; or, How I was Drowned in
the Brewery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the next item?&quot; enquired Mr. Mablethorpe
in a hollow voice, after the audience and
Mr. Mow had taken a reluctant farewell of one
another. &quot;The thumbscrew, or boiling oil?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'High Jinks in a Parisian Café,'&quot; announced
Sylvia with great satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mablethorpe coughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be prepared to read your programmes sedulously
until further notice,&quot; he said to his wife
and daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">But his fears were groundless.</p>

<p class="indent">The only occupant of the café when the curtain
rose was a waiter of melancholy aspect. To him
entered a lady and gentleman in evening dress,
arm-in-arm,&mdash;the gentleman carrying an umbrella
and smoking an unlighted cigar,&mdash;who intimated
in pantomime that they required an abundant and
satisfying meal. The waiter responded by stepping
forward and bowing so low that he fell right over
on to the back of his neck, coming up again to a
standing position after one complete revolution.
With a deeply injured expression he went down
upon his hands and knees and began to search for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span>
the obstacle over which he had tripped. Presently
he found it. It was so minute as to be quite invisible
to the audience, but when thrown into the
wings it fell with a reverberating crash.</p>

<p class="indent">Any further doubts as to the nature of the entertainment
were now dissipated by the gentleman
in evening dress, who, instead of hanging up his
opera hat in the orthodox fashion, gave his head
a backward jerk which sent the hat flying backwards
on to an adjacent gas-bracket. He next
removed his evening coat, and having lighted
his cigar from a candle upon the table, proceeded
to give a juggling exhibition with the candle, the
cigar, and his umbrella.</p>

<p class="indent">At this his lady friend withdrew, possibly in
search of a less eccentric host. The waiter, instead
of serving supper, remained a fascinated spectator
of the gentleman's performance. Presently, fired
with a spirit of emulation, he took a plate and a
raw egg from the table,&mdash;with the exception of a
property chicken the egg was the only edible thing
in the restaurant,&mdash;and having thrown the egg
into the air endeavoured to catch it upon the plate.
He succeeded. While he was wiping his face, the
lady made an unexpected reappearance. She
had left her opera cloak and evening gown in the
cloak-room, and was now attired in what looked
like a bathing-suit of tight pink silk. Evidently
having abandoned all hope of supper, she had
good-naturedly decided to come and lend a hand
with the juggling exhibition. She incited her
companion to further enterprises. At her instigation
he took the table by one leg and balanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg&nbsp;338]</span>
it upon his forehead,&mdash;fortunately the chicken
appeared to be clamped to the dish and the dish
to the table,&mdash;keeping three plates in the air with
one hand and a fourth spinning horizontally upon
the ferrule of his umbrella with the other.</p>

<p class="indent">The waiter, discouraged and fatigued by his want
of success with the egg, here opened an ingenious
little door in his own stomach, revealing a small
cupboard; and taking out a bottle and glass, proceeded
to refresh himself in the usual manner.
Then, catching the eye of the lady, who was
regarding this somewhat unusual arrangement of
nature with pardonable astonishment, he hastily
returned the bottle and glass to their place and
shut the little door. But feminine curiosity is not
easily allayed. As soon as her companion had
completed this performance with the table, the
lady drew his attention to the phenomenon which
she had just witnessed. The gentleman promptly
stepped behind the shrinking waiter, and holding
him firmly by the elbows, invited the lady by a
nod to investigate the mystery for herself. This
she did. But the opening of the door only revealed
a tiny venetian blind, drawn down and bearing
the legend, BAR CLOSED.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder how they <i>think</i> of such things!&quot; said
Sylvia rapturously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They do that to give the juggler a rest,&quot;
explained the undeceived Mr. Rayner.</p>

<p class="indent">After this the band played louder and faster, and
the gentleman took all the furniture within reach
and proceeded to hurl it into the air, keeping it
there with incredible ease through the whole of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg&nbsp;339]</span>
frenzied rendering of &quot;Il Bacio.&quot; His lady friend,
quite carried away by her enthusiasm, skipped
about the stage clapping her hands and uttering
shrill whoops. The waiter, roused to a final effort,
rushed off into the wings, to reappear with a perfect
mountain of plates. These he hurled hysterically
heavenward. They descended in all directions,
splintering into fragments amid appreciative
yells from the audience. Having caught exactly
one plate out of the avalanche, the waiter displayed
it to the house with great pride; and then (evidently
afraid of spoiling the ship for want of a
ha'porth of tar) produced a small coal-hammer
from his pocket and smashed it to atoms. The
performances concluded with a general mêlée, in
which the gentleman and lady combined to bombard
the waiter with all the plates they could lay
their hands on. But he caught them, every one
of them, two at a time; and then, once more
unlocking the door in his waistcoat and pulling up
the venetian blind, was seen generously offering
liquid refreshment to his discomfited assailants as
the curtain fell.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time the majority of Sylvia's party were
enjoying themselves thoroughly. Sylvia herself
was bubbling over; Julius Mablethorpe was shouting
like a child, and his wife, weak with laughter,
was wiping her eyes. Mr. Derek Rayner was in the
seventh heaven, for his young hostess had devoted
her entire attention to him and had hardly given
her other companion so much as a look.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps the chap is just a family friend, after
all,&quot; he said to himself optimistically.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg&nbsp;340]</span>
Philip alone was preoccupied. That morning he
had received a letter from his firm, offering him
what was practically a year's holiday. Sometime
previously the representative of a great industrial
corporation in the United States had visited
England as the guest of the Britannia Company.
He had been royally entertained; several excellent
understandings had been reached, and an important
commercial alliance cemented. Now Philip
was invited to represent the Company on a return
visit. It was a signal honour and a tempting
prospect. He would encounter fresh people and
new ideas; he would be able to enlarge his technical
knowledge, for he would go everywhere and be
shown everything; and&mdash;well, he might be able to
get a little further away from his thoughts. He
was suffering at present from a satiety of thought,
and the morning's letter had brought matters to
a crisis. Numerous forces were at war within him.</p>

<p class="indent">Chivalry said: &quot;If you may not live with her,
live for her; go your own way as far as you must,
but do not go too far: she may need you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Common sense said: &quot;Why sigh after a girl who
does not care for you, and never did? You are
nothing to her: why offer her what you do not
owe and what she cannot take?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To-night a third voice had joined in the debate.
It said: &quot;Love is not entirely a matter of twin
souls and divine passion: it has a very material
side. Life is short; we live but once: it is given to
few to encounter their affinity in this world: it is
foolish to waste one's youth waiting for a thing
which may not exist. Why not be practical? Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg&nbsp;341]</span>
not cut the Gordian knot? Marry some nice pretty
girl, with no nonsense about her, and have done
with it. Then you will have a comfortable home
and a loyal mate, and be able to turn out some
decent work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thousands of men, and tens of thousands of
women, have debated this problem in their time;
but Philip did not know this. We are apt to think
that our own human experiences are unique.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Sylvia turned to him. Her dark eyes
were full of reproach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philip, you are not listening a bit. This next
song ought to be lovely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, apologetically conning the programme,
recognised therein the name of a great singer&mdash;the
latest recruit to the variety stage&mdash;who, having
achieved a European reputation as the leading
operatic baritone of his day, had abandoned that
strenuous calling in the zenith of his drawing
powers in order to earn an ambassadorial income
by singing selections from his repertoire&mdash;which
means the hackneyed ballads beloved of the
British Public&mdash;for some fifteen minutes <i>per
diem</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the great man appeared. He began
with the Toreador's song from &quot;Carmen,&quot; which
set heads nodding and toes beating time. Then
came &quot;O Star of Eve&quot;; and last of all, &quot;I'll Sing
Thee Songs of Araby.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Struck by an unwonted stillness at his side,
Philip glanced at Sylvia. Her effervescence was
gone. With a child's instant susceptibility to external
influences her mood had changed: she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg&nbsp;342]</span>
raptly drinking in the limpid notes that came floating
to her through the smoke-laden atmosphere
of the Arena Palace of Varieties. A humorous
remark from Derek Rayner fell upon unheeding
ears. Her eyes shone, her breath came quickly;
her flower-like face was alight with tender enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>&quot;And all my song shall strive to wake</i></span><br />
<span class="i4"><i>Sweet wonder in thine eyes!&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">crooned the singer. Certainly he had achieved
his purpose in one case, Philip thought.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8"><i>&quot;To cheat thee of a sigh!</i></span><br />
<span class="i8"><i>To charm thee to a tear!&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The words died away to nothingness in the
absolute stillness of the great audience. Then,
after a brief interval, came the applause, in mighty
gusts. But during that interval Philip had had
time to hear the sound of a long tremulous sigh
close beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My reason has been saved at the eleventh
hour,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe gratefully. &quot;Talking
of the eleventh hour, shall we go home? Nothing
but the cinematograph now!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Sylvia insisted upon seeing the programme
out. Accordingly the party sat on, what time such
of the audience as still remained were plunged into
darkness and a flickering travesty of life in the
American backwoods was thrown upon the screen.</p>

<p class="indent">First came the announcement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="indent">
<i>&quot;I love you,&quot; says the Sheriff to the pretty Station
Mistress.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg&nbsp;343]</span>
There followed a picture of the Station Mistress
at home. The only visible furniture was a writing-table,
but technical detail was supplied by a lever
standing up in the middle of the floor evidently
designed to control the railway traffic of the district.
The only other notable feature of this
interior was a strong breeze. Presently the Sheriff,
a theatrical-looking young man in a slouch hat and
trousers like a pair of door-mats, sidled in at the
door; and an interpolated line of explanatory
matter enquired:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="indent">
<i>&quot;Will you come riding with me?&quot;</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Apparently the lady was willing, for next
moment she was discovered in a stable-yard blowing
a whistle. Instantly a horse appeared, saddled
and bridled, and after performing several tricks
with obvious reluctance, consented to allow itself
to be mounted, and departed at full gallop, apparently
to join the Sheriff.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guarantee that we shall meet that animal
again,&quot; prophesied Mr. Mablethorpe.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the plot began to obtrude.  As a
direct result of the Station Mistress's culpable
negligence in leaving the railway traffic to direct
itself, the way was now open for an attempt to
hold up the &quot;bullion express.&quot; This enterprise
was engineered by a gentleman called &quot;Mexican
Steve,&quot; assisted by a gang of six. Being apparently
familiar with the unbusinesslike habits of the
Station Mistress, Mexican Steve very sensibly
selected the Station Office as a suitable place
wherein to confer with his associates. The conference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg&nbsp;344]</span>
took place forthwith, the members thereof
huddling close together in order to keep within the
picture.</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="indent">
<i>&quot;The express does not stop here; we must flag her,&quot;</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">said the next line of print.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does that mean?&quot; enquired Sylvia.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fancy it means that they are going to put the
signal at danger, and so stop the train,&quot; said
Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">This, as it turned out, was a correct surmise; but
much had to happen first. As the audience had
fully expected, the symposium in the Station
House was now interrupted by the intrusion of the
Station Mistress herself, whose horror and astonishment
at finding her home in the possession of
Mexican Steve and party was a little unreasonable,
considering that she had been absent some hours
and had left the door unlocked. The ensuing
mêlée was not depicted, the screen being suddenly
changed to a railway track, with a train approaching
in the distance. There was a signal-post at the
side of the line. The signal suddenly rose to danger,
after which the scene was switched back to the
Station Office, where Mexican Steve had just
finished pulling over the lever. The Station Mistress,
it is regrettable to have to add, was sitting
bound hand and foot to her own table. The rest
of the gang disappeared, doubtless to hold up the
train. Before joining them, Mexican Steve addressed
his victim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="indent">
<i>&quot;Now, Maimie Matterson, escape if you can!&quot;</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg&nbsp;345]</span>
&quot;And she will!&quot; remarked Mr. Mablethorpe
with conviction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush!&quot; said Sylvia under her breath. &quot;Don't
spoil it!&quot; She was on tenterhooks: it was all real
to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Any doubts as to Miss Matterson's ability to
escape from her present predicament were at once
set at rest. With a few convulsive wriggles she
succeeded in getting her lips to the horse-whistle
which hung round her neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank Heaven, we can't hear her!&quot; said Mr.
Mablethorpe to his wife, as the lady's cheeks
distended themselves in a resounding blast.</p>

<p class="indent">Next moment the door was kicked down, and
Maimie's performing horse entered the room and
pawed the floor politely. Sylvia clapped her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew it!&quot; remarked Mr. Mablethorpe resignedly.</p>

<p class="indent">In obedience to a frenzied signal from his
mistress the sagacious animal first proceeded to
operate the lever in the middle of the floor, pulling
it back (presumably) to safety. This feat accomplished,
he set to work, amid thunders of applause,
to unpick with his teeth the knots which kept
Maimie Matterson bound to the table. He was
rewarded for his gallantry by being promptly
mounted and ridden at full gallop across a heartbreaking
line of country, apparently for a distance
of about twenty miles.</p>

<p class="indent">Then for the last time the scene changed to the
railway track. The train, which had covered quite
two hundred yards in the last quarter of an hour,
was now close to the post, and Mexican Steve and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg&nbsp;346]</span>
his friends were crouching by the line armed with
six-shooters. Above their heads the signal-arm still
stood at danger. Suddenly it dropped.</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="indent">
<i>&quot;Who did that?&quot;</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">inquired an indignant line of print.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was the dear horse!&quot; replied Sylvia triumphantly.</p>

<p class="indent">The train, which had been exhibiting signs of
indecision, suddenly quickened its pace and shot
past, to the discomfiture of the desperadoes, who
childishly fired a volley at the wheels. Next
moment an armed band, headed by the Sheriff and
Miss Maimie Matterson,&mdash;they must have covered
forty miles in something like fifteen seconds,&mdash;dashed
out of an adjacent wood. After a perfunctory
struggle the incompetent criminals were
duly taken into custody and marched off by their
captors. The Sheriff, having got rid of his posse,
seized the opportunity to indulge in an exchange
of tender endearments with Miss Matterson.</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="indent">
<i>&quot;We will find the preacher-man, right now!&quot;</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent">he declared.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Matterson's reply was not recorded in
print, but to judge from the last few yards of the
film, it was of an encouraging nature.</p>

<p class="indent">As the Sheriff's arms closed round the unresisting
form of his athletic bride, Philip was conscious
of a gentle movement beside him. Then a small,
warm, gloved hand was slipped into his own in the
darkness. He made no sign: he merely allowed the
hand to rest where it lay. Presently it was withdrawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[pg&nbsp;347]</span>
as softly as it came. It was a brief, almost
momentary episode, but it settled the course of
Philip's life for him.</p>

<p class="indent">The lights went up; a blurred and bearded figure
was thrown upon the screen; and the band, rising
to its feet, offered a hurried tribute of loyalty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supper?&quot; suggested Mr. Mablethorpe to the
company in general.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must all be my guests to-night,&quot; said
Philip. &quot;I may not have another opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At supper he told them that he was going to
America for a year at least.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I presume,&quot; said Mr. Mablethorpe, as they
sat alone together after Sylvia and her mother
had gone to bed, &quot;that when you do return from
your travels we must not expect to see&mdash;quite
so much of you as hitherto?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I think not,&quot; replied Philip. Then he added
awkwardly, &quot;You understand the situation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Julius Mablethorpe nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I do, and I know you are right.
There is a power of difference between giving
one's best and one's second best. You can't compromise
over the really big things of life: with
them it must be everything or nothing. You are
doing the right thing. But we shall miss you, my
son Philip,&mdash;all of us!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">So our knight rode away, exceeding sorrowful.
His departure was mourned by many, notably one,&mdash;but
not by Mr. Derek Rayner.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXVIII" id="XXVIII"></a>XXVIII</h2>

<p class="h3">A BRAND FROM THE BURNING</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> liner Bosphorus, after a comfortable nap
of some eight days in the Mersey, was making a
reluctant effort to tear herself from the land of her
birth and face an unfriendly ocean upon her
seventy-eighth voyage to New York. Motive
power for the time being was supplied by four
fussy tugboats, three of which were endeavouring
to speed the parting guest by valiant pushings in
the neighbourhood of her rudder, while the fourth
initiated a turning movement at her starboard
bow. An occasional rumble from the engine-room
announced that the tugs would soon have no
excuse for further officiousness.</p>

<p class="indent">The cabin passengers were leaning over the
rails of the upper deck, surveying the busy landing-stage.
They were chiefly males&mdash;their wives
were down below, engaged in the unprofitable
task of endeavouring to intimidate stewardesses&mdash;and
were for the most part Americans. Philip
stood apart, watching the variegated farewells of
the crowd.</p>

<p class="indent">The etiquette of valediction at the sailing of a
great ship varies with the three classes of passenger.
The friends of cabin passengers accept a
final drink, say good-bye, leave the ship, and are no
more seen. The friends and relations of the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg&nbsp;349]</span>
class&mdash;and they are <i>all</i> there&mdash;line up along
the landing-stage and maintain a running fire of
chaff and invective until the ship has been warped
out into the stream and the engines begin to run.
The steerage and their friends, being mainly aliens
and knowing no better, weep and howl.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip knew that the second-class passengers
were on the deck below him; but as he could not
see them (though he could hear them) his attention
wandered to the throng which was engaging
them in conversation. They were of many types.
There were people who shouted cheerfully, &quot;Well,
send us a line when you get there!&quot; and then,
after a laborious attempt to discover another
topic, cried despairingly, &quot;Well, don't forget to
write!&quot; And so on. &quot;Give my love to Milly when
you see her,&quot; commanded a stout matron in bugles,
&quot;and say I hope her cold is better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Farther along, a girl with tears raining down her
cheeks was more than holding her own in an
exchange of biting personalities with a grimy
gentleman at a porthole&mdash;apparently her <i>fiancé</i>&mdash;whom
she had come to see off. A comic man,
mistaking a blast upon the siren for a definite
indication that the moment of departure had
arrived, took out a dirty pocket-handkerchief and
wept loudly, periodically squeezing the handkerchief
dry and beginning again. But it was a false
alarm: the ship did not move; and his performance,
which was to have been the crowning effort of a
strenuously humorous morning, continued perforce
to halt lamely along for another ten minutes.
Finally, in response to an urgent appeal from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[pg&nbsp;350]</span>
matter-of-fact lady friend that he would not act
the goat, the unfortunate gentleman, submitting to
the fate of all those whose enterprises are born out
of due time, put his handkerchief sheepishly in his
pocket and took no further part in the proceedings.</p>

<p class="indent">At last the Bosphorus swung clear. There was
a jingle of bells deep down in the engine-room,
followed by a responsive throb of life throughout
the hitherto inert mass of the great vessel. The
voyage had begun.</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd on the landing-stage broke into a
cheer, which was answered from all parts of the
ship. As the sound died away a girl stepped
forward and waved her handkerchief for the last
time. She was a short girl, with a pleasant face,
and wore glasses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye, Lil, dear!&quot; she cried.</p>

<p class="indent">There was an answering flutter from directly
below where Philip stood, and a clear voice
replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye, May, darling!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip scrutinised the girl on the landing-stage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who on earth is that?&quot; he said to himself.
Then he remembered. It was Miss May Jennings,
sister of Miss Lil Jennings, typist at the office in
Oxford Street.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Having taken part, with distinction, in the free
fight round the person of the second steward which
our great steamship companies regard as the only
possible agency through which seats at table
can be booked for a voyage, and having further
secured a position for his chair and rug from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[pg&nbsp;351]</span>
deck-steward, Philip took stock of his surroundings.</p>

<p class="indent">Transatlantic ship's company is never very interesting.
The trip is too short to make it possible
for the pleasant people to get to know one
another: only the bores and thrusters have time
to make their presence felt. On this occasion the
saloon appeared to be divided fairly evenly between
music-hall artistes and commercial travellers
of Semitic origin; so Philip, wrapped up in a
rug, addressed himself to the task of overtaking
some of the arrears of sleep due to him after the
recently completed Joy-Week.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning, experiencing a desire for society,
Philip descended a deck upon a visit to the second
class, feeling tolerably certain that here, at least,
he would find a friend.</p>

<p class="indent">He was right. Miss Jennings was sitting by
herself under the lee of the boiler casing, perusing
a novel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, after an exchange of greetings,
&quot;I dare say you are a bit surprised to see me. I'm
a trifle that way myself. I only settled to do it a
week ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not even know you had left the Britannia
Company,&quot; said Philip, sitting down. &quot;Tell me
about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; explained Miss Jennings, &quot;there isn't
much to tell. I got tired of Oxford Street. It
didn't seem to be leading to much, and I wasn't
getting any younger; and just about six months
ago I had had a letter from a girl friend of mine
who had settled in New York, saying that a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg&nbsp;352]</span>
stenographer could do twice as well there as in
London. So I decided to go&mdash;if only for a bit of
a change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about your mother and sister?&quot; asked
Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you haven't heard. Poor Mother died over
a year ago, when you were away at Coventry.
I'm just out of black for her now. May is married.
I have been living with her and Tom for some time
back. I didn't like it much. Makes you feel
inferior-like, living in a house belonging to a
married sister that's plainer than yourself. That's
all about me. I hope you are very well, Mr.
Meldrum. You are out on the Company's business,
I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip. He explained the nature of
his trip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They were saying at Oxford Street,&quot; pursued
Miss Jennings, with the air of one who is anxious
to avoid all appearance of asking for information,
&quot;that you were going to be made a partner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was talked about,&quot; said Philip, &quot;but nothing
at all came of it. They wanted me to risk rather
more capital in the business than I happen to
possess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you worry about capital, Mr. Meldrum,&quot;
said Miss Jennings. &quot;It's your brains they're after.
Bob Br&mdash;a gentleman I know told me that he had
heard from some one behind the scenes that they
don't mean to let you go at any price. They can't
afford to have your inventions taken up by other
people. It was just a try-on, telling you you must
put a lot of money into the business. Next time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[pg&nbsp;353]</span>
they mention the matter, you name your terms
and <i>stick</i> to them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip thanked her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I've no call,&quot; admitted Miss Jennings,
&quot;to be giving you advice. But I wasn't born with
my mouth sewn up, and you never were one to
put yourself forward, were you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip admitted that possibly this was true, and
the conversation passed to the inevitable topic of
old times and old friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How is Brand, by the way?&quot; asked Philip.
&quot;He was an admirer of yours, I believe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brand?&quot; said Miss Jennings carelessly. &quot;Oh&mdash;the
mechanic? I believe he is getting on very
well. First foreman, then manager of the garage;
and now that you are gone he and Mr. Rendle
pretty well own the earth between them, so I
gather. Brand is quite the gentleman now. I hear
he has given up making a spectacle of himself in
the Park of a Sunday. Mr. Rendle is the same as
ever. He misses you at the flat, though.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You seem to know all about our domestic
arrangements,&quot; said Philip, much amused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody that wasn't born deaf-and-dumb,&quot;
said Miss Jennings with decision, &quot;could see
Mr. Rendle six hours a day for six days a week
without knowing every blessed thing about him,
and a jolly sight more, from his own lips. His
young ladies, and everything! He brought one to
Oxford Street, the other day. He told me afterwards&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was she like?&quot; asked Philip instantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn't notice her particularly. She was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg&nbsp;354]</span>
the show-room looking at motors most of the time,
and only stepped into the office for a minute. She
was quite simply dressed, it being the morning,
but her clothes were good all through. I picked up
two or three ideas for myself straight off. Shoes,
for one thing. Hers were the neatest I ever saw&mdash;brown
<i>suède</i> with silver buckles. No cheap American
ready-mades, or anything of that kind. As
for her coat and skirt, you could see they'd been
cut by a tailor, and her hat was one of these simple
little things that fit close to the head and look as
if they could be put together for half-nothing;
but I know better. It came out of&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was she like?&quot; repeated a patient voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm trying to tell you,&quot; replied Miss Jennings,
a little offended.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but her appearance? Not her clothes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings pondered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn't really have time to notice her appearance,&quot;
she said at length; &quot;but she was what I
should call a middling blonde. She was wearing
one of those new blouses, with a V-shaped&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it must have been Miss Falconer,&quot;
said Philip, with an air of great detachment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that was the name,&quot; replied Miss Jennings.
&quot;Mr. Rendle told me he was very sorry for her.
He said thousands of gentlemen were in love with
her&mdash;you know the silly way he talks&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip, with a gulp. &quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she could never marry any of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I wonder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because of her father,&quot; explained the everready
Miss Jennings. &quot;She won't ever leave him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg&nbsp;355]</span>
him being a widower, and very peculiar in his
manner, and unable to look after himself. A bit
silly-like, from all accounts. Seems to me to be
asking a good lot of a girl, to stay at home to look
after an old image like that. That's only supposing,
of course, that she <i>wants</i> to marry one of these
thousands of hers. She's welcome to the lot, so far
as I'm concerned.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, rather!&quot; agreed Philip absently.</p>

<p class="indent">So <i>that</i> was the reason! And he had never
guessed. Well, it made his own chances no brighter,
but it took a load from his mind. Peggy was back
on a higher pedestal than ever, and her silent
knight could now worship her without reservation.
She was acquitted for all time of the charge of
being hard, or callous, or unfeminine.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The Bosphorus was rolling heavily when Philip
rose next morning, but his sea-legs were good, and
he proceeded to his toilet with no particular
pangs save those of hunger. After shaving he put
on a dressing-gown and staggered along an alleyway
in search of a bath. Presently an illuminated
sign informed him that he had reached his destination.
He turned into the first empty bathroom,
where a man in a white jacket was tidying up after
the last occupant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bath, please,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Chill just off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man turned his back and set going a spouting
cataract, and the bath was half-full of salt
water in less than a minute. There are no corporation
restrictions or half-inch pipes in oceanic bathrooms:
you simply open a sluice and let in as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg&nbsp;356]</span>
of the Atlantic as you require. The man next
lowered a long hinged pipe into the bottom of
the bath, and gave a twist to a little valve-wheel
on the wall. Straightway a violent subaqueous
crackling announced that live steam from the
boilers was performing its allotted task of taking
the chill off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will do, thank you,&quot; said Philip presently.</p>

<p class="indent">The bath-steward turned off the valve, and the
crackling ceased. Philip sat down upon the edge
of the bath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Brand,&quot; he said, &quot;how does the Bosphorus
compare with Oxford Street?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He held out his hand, and Mr. Brand, having
overcome his surprise, shook it resentfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you are surprised to come across me
here,&quot; he remarked defiantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not altogether,&quot; replied Philip, thinking of the
second class; &quot;but I did not expect to find you
swabbing bathrooms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn't going to waste good money travelling
as a passenger,&quot; said Brand sullenly. &quot;I tried to
get taken on in the engine-room, but they wouldn't
look at me without marine engineering experience;
so I had to be content with this. It's only for a
week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You aren't coming back, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It depends,&quot; said Brand shortly. &quot;Not at
present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you given up the Britannia Company?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes: handed in me resignation Friday afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[pg&nbsp;357]</span>
&quot;What on earth for? You were climbing to the
top of the tree there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I preferred to be on the ground,&quot; said Brand
oracularly.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip decided not to press for information.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still, I'm sorry,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why? I wasn't fired, if that's what you
mean,&quot; said Brand swiftly.</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment another passenger came tacking
down the alleyway, and Brand departed in the
further execution of his official duties.</p>

<p class="indent">There are no facilities upon ocean liners for
promoting social intercourse between bath-stewards
and cabin passengers, so Philip did not see Brand
again until the same hour the following morning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the way, Brand,&quot; he said, as he waited for
the proper adjustment of the bath's temperature,
&quot;there is a mutual friend of ours on board, travelling
second class. Did you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Brand thickly, &quot;I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He swung the steam-pipe savagely back into its
clip, flung two hot towels down on a seat, and departed,
banging the door behind him. That was
the beginning and end of the second day's conversation.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Philip saw nothing of Miss Jennings during the
next few days, for the weather continued to be
boisterous, and that lady&mdash;unlike other and less
considerate members of the ship's company&mdash;preferred
to endure the pangs of <i>mal-de-mer</i> in the
seclusion of her own cabin. It was not until the
fourth day out that he saw her again. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg&nbsp;358]</span>
reclining languidly in a chair, convalescent, but
obviously disinclined for conversation. Philip
passed her by.</p>

<p class="indent">The fifth day broke bright and sunny, and the
Bosphorus, clear of the Newfoundland Banks, with
their accompanying fogs and ground-swell, became
a centre of social activity. Vigorous couples
tramped up and down, snuffing the breeze. Unpleasant
children ran shrieking round the deck,
galloping over the same sets of toes at regular
intervals. Elderly gentlemen played interminable
games of deck-quoits and bull-board. In the
smoking-room enthusiastic alcoholists gathered,
to splice the main brace and bid in the auction
sweep-stake on the day's run. New York was only
twenty-four hours away.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, descending to his cabin for a book, passed
Citizen Brand, polishing cabin doorhandles with
fierce energy. He paused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brand,&quot; he said, &quot;I want to have a palaver
with you. Can you come and see me in my cabin
this evening?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Brand considered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall get a telling-off from the second steward
if I do,&quot; he said. &quot;Regular Cossack, he is. This
ship's full of rotten rules and red-tape. Still, after
all, he can only sack me, which will save me the
trouble of deserting. All right: I'll come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He appeared in Philip's cabin at ten o'clock that
night, and consented to drink whiskey-and-water
out of a tooth-glass.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; enquired Philip, lighting his pipe, &quot;what
are your prospects in the States. Got a berth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg&nbsp;359]</span>
&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Brand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going on a visit to some of the big establishments
out there. If I come across anything that
would suit you, shall I put it in your way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Brand thanked him gruffly, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. I don't know what to say. The
fact is, I don't know where I shall have to live
yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have to live?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, have to live. I can't settle anything. I&mdash;Oh,
damn it, I don't know! Leave me alone!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He sat staring savagely at the floor, with his
head in his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brand, my friend,&quot; remarked Philip, puffing
at his pipe, &quot;you and I have been acquainted for
a considerable time now, haven't we?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Brand nodded, and Philip continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going to assume the privilege of an old
friend, and enquire into your private affairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fat lot of information you'll get,&quot; was the
gracious reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, then,&quot; said Philip cheerfully. &quot;I
won't enquire: I'll assume. Having assumed that
everything I meant to ask about is as I think it is,
I'll tell you something. It's this: you are a pretty
good chap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Brand's gloomy eyes turned upon Philip suspiciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he snarled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean this. You have done a pretty fine
thing. If the information interests you, I may tell
you that you have taught me a lesson; but that's
beside the point. Last Friday you were in a comfortable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg&nbsp;360]</span>
berth, doing well, and rising rapidly.
To-day you are a bath-steward, without any status
or prospects. Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I'm a blasted fool,&quot; replied Brand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don't think so,&quot; continued Philip, &quot;I
prefer to look at it differently. You have sacrificed
everything, and staked your whole future&mdash;on
what? On an Idea&mdash;a single Idea. I call that a
pretty fine thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What Idea?&quot; snapped Brand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A very pretty little Idea,&quot; said Philip. &quot;She is
now sleeping peacefully two decks below this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Brand sprang to his feet, his eyes blazing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why not?&quot; he demanded. &quot;Do you deny
my right to follow her, and look after her, and see
she comes to no harm, whatever she may think of
me or do to me? I love her! Do you understand
what that means? I love her! Gentlemen like you
and Rendle, you don't know the meanin' of the
word. With you it's just: 'Fine girl, what? Come
and have supper at the Savoy to-night!' That's
what you call love!&quot; Brand's arms were waving:
he was rapidly lapsing into his old Hyde Park
manner. &quot;When you've finished with one girl, or
the girl's finished with you, what do you do? Kiss
your 'and and get another! Bah!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what do you do, Brand,&quot; enquired Philip
imperturbably, &quot;when a lady gives you up?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I give up my job: I give up everything, so as to
be free; and I follow her. That's what I do. She's
a child: she's not able to look after herself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, my impression of Miss Jennings's character,&quot;
said Philip, &quot;is exactly the opposite. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg&nbsp;361]</span>
rarely met a woman who seemed to me so well-balanced
and self-possessed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Up to a point, and in a manner of speaking,&quot;
agreed Brand, conversing more rationally now,
&quot;you are right. But that's a woman all over. She
may keep her head for months at a time, and snap
her fingers at man after man; and then one fine day
a fellow comes along that's no better than fifty
others she's turned down&mdash;and what does she
do? She goes potty! She crumples up! She crawls
round him and eats out of his hand! Why is it?
In God's name, sir, why is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His head dropped into his hands again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When did this happen?&quot; asked Philip gently.
He felt strangely awed in the presence of this
elemental soul.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll tell you,&quot; said Brand. &quot;It'll do me good.
She and I had been getting on pretty well of late.
We weren't exactly engaged, but she allowed no
other man near her but me. I gave up a lot to
please her. I gave up speaking in the Park, because
she said it wasn't gentlemanly. I joined the
Church of England&mdash;me that's been a Freethinker
ever since I could think! I gave up being a
Socialist, because she said it was low. I cut my
wings, and clamped myself down, and dressed
myself up like a Guy Fawkes&mdash;all to please her.
I let her order me about, and I liked it! I liked
it! That's pretty degrading, ain't it? I felt degraded
and in love at the same time, if you know
what I mean. That's a rotten state to be in, I
don't think!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip was listening intently. Somewhere in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg&nbsp;362]</span>
back of his mind he felt that he had heard this
story before. Then he remembered Uncle Joseph,
and realised that all human experience appears to
run upon much the same lines.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we were happy enough,&quot; continued
Brand, &quot;for a matter of two years or so. The only
trouble was that when I suggested marriage she
said she was very comfortable as she was and did
not want to lose her independence. (They're all
for independence nowadays: I don't know what
causes it: Board Schools, perhaps.) In her company
I was too pleased with life ever to argue
about anything, so I didn't press it. But there
was one big risk that I overlooked, and that was
the risk of another man butting in. And that's
just what happened. A feller came along. He had
everything that I hadn't&mdash;fine manners and
plenty of silly talk, and nasty little love-making
ways. He put the come-hither on Lil. As I told you
in a fortnight she was eating out of his hand. I'm
not the man to take that sort of thing lying down.
I asked her straight what she meant by it. She
flared up, and asked when I had been appointed
her keeper. I said we was engaged. She said we
was no such thing. I said if we wasn't it was about
time, considering all things, that we was. She
asked what I meant by that. I said if she had any
sort of notion of fair play she would know. After
that she told me she never wanted to see me again.
I said she was only anticipating my own wishes;
and we parted. We ain't spoke since. That was
six weeks ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What became of the other man?&quot; asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[pg&nbsp;363]</span>
Brand smiled grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Him? I went to him next day, and told him if
ever he spoke to Lil again I'd push his face in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did he say to that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was most gentlemanly about it. Oh, <i>most</i>
gentlemanly!&quot; Brand assumed the mincing accent
which he reserved for his impersonations of the
aristocracy. &quot;Told me he had no desire to come
between an honest working-man and his future
wife. Said he was not <i>permanently</i> interested in the
lady! He got no further than that, because that
was where I <i>did</i> push his face in. He was a nasty
sight when I'd finished with him. He never went
near Lil again, though,&mdash;the rabbit! Since than
not a word has passed between her and me, except
when business required. Then, last Friday, I saw
her going round the office and garage saying good-bye
to everybody&mdash;except me, of course&mdash;and
telling them she was going to America. I waited
till the dinner-hour; then wrote to headquarters,
resigned my job, and went straight to Liverpool,
where I managed to get signed on aboard this
boat. That's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you going to do when you get to
New York?&quot; asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. It depends on what Lil does,&quot;
replied single-minded Citizen Brand.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, how do you like the prospect of New
York to-morrow, Miss Jennings?&quot; asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">They were leaning over the taffrail in the calm
darkness, watching the phosphorescent wake of the
great propellers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>[pg&nbsp;364]</span>
&quot;At the present moment,&quot; confessed Miss
Jennings frankly, &quot;I don't like it at all. It's a way
things have when you get right up against them.
They don't look so nice as they did at a distance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not in your usual spirits to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said the girl, &quot;and that's a fact. I'm not.
Worst of being a woman is that you can't trust
yourself to be sensible all the time. You do a thing,
and you know you're doing right, and you go on
knowing it was right for weeks on end; and then,
just when you want to feel that you were right
most especially, you go and feel that you've been
wrong all the time. Silly, I call it! Sometimes I
want to shake myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You feel you wish you had not left London?
Is that the trouble?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye&mdash;es,&quot; said Miss Jennings reluctantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm surprised,&quot; said Philip, cautiously opening
fire, &quot;that you were ever allowed to forsake your
native land.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who by?&quot; enquired Miss Jennings swiftly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there are a good many thousand young
men there, you know. It doesn't show much enterprise
on their part&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Meldrum,&quot; remarked Miss Jennings
frankly, &quot;if you start making pretty speeches, the
end of the world must be coming. A good many
thousand young men, indeed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; persisted the abashed but pertinacious
Philip, &quot;let us say one young man. Surely there
was just one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings was silent for a moment. Then
she replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg&nbsp;365]</span>
&quot;Yes, there was one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;More than one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. At least, there was only one that I really
fancied. It was a queer thing that I should have
cared for him at all. (It's all over now, so there's
no harm in my telling you about it.) We were
always having words one way and another. We
had nothing in common, really. Very stuck on his
opinions he was, and always laying down the law.
His ideas weren't very gentlemanly, either. He
was a Socialist, and didn't belong to the Church;
but I cured him of that. I must say I improved
him wonderfully.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was he grateful?&quot; asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was, and he wasn't. He would do anything
I asked him; but if it went against the grain with
him to do it he would say so before he did it&mdash;sometimes
all the time he was doing it; and that
rather spoils your pleasure, doesn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should have thought it would increase it,&quot;
said Philip. &quot;It would show your great power over
him, that you should be able to compel him to do
things against his will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings deliberated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you are right,&quot; she said at last. &quot;I
hadn't thought of it that way. Still, his back-chat
used to worry me to death. And his temper! It
was so fierce, I was frightened of him. He was
fierce, too, in the way he loved me. He would
carry on something dreadful at times.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In what way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, supposing I made an appointment with
him, and changed my mind and didn't go&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[pg&nbsp;366]</span>
&quot;Did you do that often?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, sometimes. It's a good thing to do,&quot;
explained the experienced Miss Jennings. &quot;If you
don't act like that sometimes&mdash;promise to meet
him somewhere and then forget&mdash;a man begins to
think he's engaged to you. If a girl doesn't respect
herself, who else will? That's what I say. Then his
jealousy&mdash;my word!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment Miss Jennings's cheerful little
Cockney voice grew quite shrill. Then came an
expressive silence, which Philip construed as an
aposiopetic allusion to this young gentleman whose
face had been pushed in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still,&quot; he persisted gently, &quot;you were fond of
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings did not answer immediately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose I was,&quot; she admitted at last. &quot;But
I think I was more sorry for him, if you know what
I mean. He didn't know how to look after himself:
he was like a child: he wanted a nurse. But if ever
I did try to do anything for him, he took it up
wrong. He thought I was getting soft on him, and
before you could turn round he was trying to lord
it over me. No, this affair never came to anything.
It never could: we were made too different, both
of us. Forget it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings ceased, and surveyed the long
moonlit streak of foam astern rather wistfully.
To-night the land she knew and the man she had
been sorry for seemed to have receded to infinity:
over the bow of the ship the unknown was creeping,
hand over hand, inexorably. She sighed, and then
shivered. She was realising the truth of her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[pg&nbsp;367]</span>
dictum on the subject of a woman's inability to be
sensible all the time.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the voice of Philip broke the silence,
expounding the simple philosophy of his simple life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know,&quot; he said, &quot;I think that all
things are possible to two people who are prepared
to make allowances for one another? You and the
man you speak of both possess strong natures.
You both wanted to be master. You both hated
conceding anything. He regarded the acts of
worship that a woman expects of the man who
loves her as a form of humiliation; he was content
to make good by material homage&mdash;presents,
theatres, and so on. You on your part felt that
in accepting these things from him you were
weakening your own independence and laying
yourself under an obligation to him. So he, when
he made actual love to you, did so reluctantly and
half-heartedly&mdash;didn't he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think he did!&quot; affirmed the epicurean
Miss Jennings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;While you could never accept his gifts and
his arrangements for your entertainment without
just a little&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;a dash of
vinegar?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's it,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now,&quot; proceeded Philip, too much immersed
in his subject to be surprised at his own fluency,
&quot;when two people who love one another reach
that stage, they must get over it at once, or there
will be friction, and finally disaster. Each must
learn at once to consider things from the other's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg&nbsp;368]</span>
point of view&mdash;make allowances, in fact. Brand
ought to&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot; enquired a sharp voice at his side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;Brand. It was Brand, wasn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jennings nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said simply, &quot;it was Brand. Go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brand,&quot; continued Philip, &quot;ought to have remembered
that you were a woman, with all a
woman's reserve and instinct of self-defence; and
that you could not be expected to wear your heart
upon your sleeve.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he ought to have remembered that,&quot;
agreed Miss Jennings. &quot;But what about me?
What should I have remembered?&quot; She appeared
almost anxious to be scolded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This,&quot; said Philip&mdash;&quot;that Brand was a proud,
passionate man, of very humble birth, terrified of
showing you his heart and being laughed at for his
pains&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl nodded again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;you are right. I ought to have
remembered that. I forgot his feelings sometimes.
Poor Bob!&quot; she added pensively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you see,&quot; concluded Philip, thankful to
feel that his homily was almost delivered, &quot;if only
you two could get accustomed to regarding one
another in that light, the barrier would be down
for ever. A barrier can never stand for a moment
when it is attacked from both sides. Make allowances,
Miss Jennings! Make allowances! Get to
know one another; study one another; appreciate
one another! Then Brand can pour out for you
all that shy, inarticulate worship of his, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[pg&nbsp;369]</span>
fear of indifference or ridicule, and you can surrender
with all the honours of war. Will you try?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will I try?&quot; echoed Miss Jennings wonderingly.
&quot;Isn't it a little late in the day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;would you try?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would I?&quot; Miss Jennings's voice suddenly
broke. &quot;What's the use of my trying?&quot; she
demanded tearfully. &quot;Bob's on the other side of
the world now&mdash;taken up with another girl as
likely as not. What's the good of asking me what
I would do when I can't do it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was crying in earnest now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supposing&mdash;just supposing&mdash;&quot; began Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, stop your supposing!&quot; the girl blazed out
passionately. &quot;Don't you see I can't bear it? I
want him! I'm frightened of everything, and I
want Bob! And it's too late!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stay exactly where you are for about five
minutes,&quot; commanded Philip. And he disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">A few minutes later Bath-Steward Brand was
incurring the risk of ignominious expulsion from
the service of the merchant marine by trespassing
upon a portion of the deck strictly reserved for
passengers.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip went to bed.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Philip, leaning over the forward rail of the boatdeck
and surveying the silhouette of New York,
rising like a row of irregular teeth upon the distant
horizon, talked to himself in order to keep his
spirits up.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>[pg&nbsp;370]</span>
&quot;Theophilus, my lad,&quot;&mdash;he liked to call himself
by that name, because Peggy had sometimes used
it,&mdash;&quot;so far, your scheme of fresh friends and
pastures new has turned out a fizzle. You took this
trip in order to see new faces and make new friends,
and generally put the past behind you. The net
result is that you have not made a single new
acquaintance. Instead, you have devoted your
entire energies to interfering in the affairs of a
second-class lady passenger and a bath-steward,
neither of whom can be described under any
circumstances as a new friend. You must make a real
effort when you land.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Fate was against him. He descended to the
saloon, and having there satisfied an Immigration
official, sitting behind a pile of papers, that he was
neither a pauper, a lunatic, nor an anarchist, could
read and write, and was not suffering from any
disease of the eyeball, he purchased one of the
newspapers which the pilot had brought on board
in the early morning, and retired to a sunny corner
to occupy himself, after a week's abstention, in
getting abreast of the news of the day. He unfolded
the crackling sheet.</p>

<p class="indent">It was his first introduction to that stupendous
organ of private opinion, the American newspaper....
When he had recovered his breath, and the
shouting scarelines had focussed themselves into
some sort of proportion, he worked methodically
through the entire journal, discovering ultimately,
to his relief, that nothing very dreadful had
happened after all. He had almost finished, when
his eye fell upon a small paragraph at the foot of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[pg&nbsp;371]</span>
column, with its headlines set in comparatively
modest type.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>We cull the following from the London &quot;Times&quot;:</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Falconer-Leslie. At St. Peter's, Eaton Square,
on the 4th inst., Montagu Falconer, A.R.A., to
Jean Leslie, only daughter of the late General Sir
Ian Leslie, V.C., of Inverdurie, Invernesshire.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A quarter of a column followed, expatiating upon
the fact that the wedding took place very quietly
at ten o'clock in the morning, and that reporters
had met with a discouraging reception from the
bridegroom. Then came a list of Montagu's best-known
pictures. But Philip did not read it. He
threw the paper down on deck, and started to his
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">The Bosphorus had come to a standstill at the
opening of her berth, waiting for the tugs to turn
her in. Protruding from the next opening was the
forepart of a monster liner, from whose four funnels
smoke was spouting.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[pg&nbsp;372]</span>
Philip enquired of a passing quartermaster:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What ship is that, please?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Caspian, sir. Our record-breaker!&quot; said
the man, with proper pride. &quot;She sails for Liverpool
at noon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour later Philip found himself and his
belongings dumped upon the Continent of America.
A minion of the rapacious but efficient ring
of buccaneers which controls the entire transport
system of the United States confronted him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where shall I express your baggage?&quot; he
enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can put it on board the Caspian,&quot; replied
Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gee!&quot; remarked the expressman admiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some hustler, ain't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am,&quot; said Philip&mdash;&quot;this trip! Get busy!&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXIX" id="XXIX"></a>XXIX</h2>

<p class="h3">THE FIRST EPISTLE OF THEOPHILUS</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Pretty</span> hot stuff this port of yours, old son&mdash;what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take some more,&quot; grunted Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. That <i>was</i> the situation I was
endeavouring to lead up to,&quot; said Timothy, and
helped himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's a blessing to see your honest but homely
features once again,&quot; he continued, lifting his
glass, &quot;especially when you signalise your return
by replenishing the wine-cellar. Chin-chin, old
thing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, sitting on one chair with his feet on
another and smoking a briar pipe, grunted again.
Timothy rose, and lit a cigarette with a live coal
from the fire. (Matches were never a conspicuous
feature of a bachelor establishment, however well
regulated.) As he did so, his eye was caught by a
pair of tall and hideous vases,&mdash;of the kind which
is usually given away at coöperative stores to
customers who have been rash enough to accumulate
a certain number of coupons,&mdash;standing one at
each end of the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my dear old Theophilus,&quot; moaned the
æsthetic Timothy, &quot;do you mean to say you have
resurrected the Bulgarian Atrocities?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The ornaments in question had been a Christmas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[pg&nbsp;374]</span>
present from Mrs. Grice. (&quot;I bought 'em just
before closing-time at a Sale of Work what my
married sister in the Wandsworth Road was
interested in, sir,&quot; she had explained. &quot;A Sale of
Work in aid of the Bulgarian Atrocities, it was.
I said to Grice at the time that they would brighten
up your room something wonderful. There they
are, sir, with our respectful Christmas wishes&mdash;one
from Grice and one from me. Oh, thank you
sir!&quot;) Hence their name.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip; &quot;Mrs. Grice got them out of
the cupboard as soon as I returned, and they were
duly washed and put up this morning. I was
hoping she had forgotten about them; but they
will have to stay there now. We mustn't offend
the old lady. You are a tremendous swell to-night,
Tim. Going out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tim importantly, &quot;I am.&quot; He
produced a pair of white gloves and began to try
them on, surveying Philip's aged dinner-jacket and
black tie with tolerant indulgence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must now pull myself together,&quot; he announced,
turning to survey an appallingly tight
white waistcoat with immense satisfaction in the
glass over the mantelpiece, &quot;and pass along
quietly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You needn't go yet,&quot; said Philip, filling another
pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Despite your frenzied entreaties, old son,&quot;
replied Timothy, &quot;I simply must. There is going
to be dirty work at the crossroads to-night,&quot; he
added mysteriously.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip, who gathered that a confidence of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[pg&nbsp;375]</span>
kind was on the way, waited. It was good to see
Timothy again. His company was always exhilarating,
and at the present juncture it was extra
welcome. For Philip found himself at an unexpectedly
loose end. He had landed from the
Caspian a week before, determined this time to put
his whole fate to the touch&mdash;only to find that his
Lady was not in London. Friends in Hampshire&mdash;he
knew neither their name nor address, and was
much too self-conscious to enquire at Tite Street&mdash;had
snatched her away directly after her father's
wedding, and the date of her return was uncertain.
Therefore he leaned at this moment upon Timothy.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Tim enquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Phil, ever been in love, old friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was a familiar gambit, and Philip gave his
usual reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Occasionally.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything doing at present? Anything fresh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing to write home about, thanks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy surveyed his friend critically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder,&quot; he said musingly, &quot;if Romance
could ever really find a lurking-place in that gearless,
valveless little heart!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afraid not,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Romance gives old
fossils like me the go-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't talk rot of that kind, Phil,&quot; replied the
boy quickly. &quot;Any woman would be proud to
marry you. Fool if she wasn't!&quot; he added, with
real sincerity.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip responded by waving his glass in his
friend's direction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Rendle, your health and sentiment!&quot; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[pg&nbsp;376]</span>
remarked gravely. He drank; laid down the glass;
and sat up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, my son Timothy,&quot; he remarked
briskly, &quot;get it off your chest! Own up! Who is
she? When do the banns go up&mdash;eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get what off my chest?&quot; enquired Tim, with
a great appearance of surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This great secret. Cough it up! Who is the
lady?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">One of Philip's greatest virtues in the eyes of
Timothy was that he never, under any circumstances,
ended that particular question with &quot;this
time.&quot; But he was genuinely surprised at Philip's
penetration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great Scott! It must be written all over me if
you can spot it, old Bartimæus!&quot; he said, not
altogether displeased. &quot;Yes, you are right. It
has happened at last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>It!</i> I'm in love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It comes to us all, sooner or later,&quot; remarked
Philip tactfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I am going,&quot; announced Tim with great
firmness, &quot;to bring it off this very night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip glanced at the clock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quarter to ten,&quot; he said. &quot;A bit late to begin
a job of that magnitude to-night, isn't it? Are you
going to apply personally, or by letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's that?&quot; enquired Timothy, emerging
from a rapturous reverie.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip repeated the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Letter?&quot; exclaimed Tim with infinite scorn&mdash;&quot;a
letter? Write? Write a letter? My sainted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>[pg&nbsp;377]</span>
aunt, <i>write</i>?&quot; He gazed indignantly upon the
automaton before him that called itself a man.
&quot;My dear old relic of the Stone Age&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the Stone Age,&quot; observed the relic, &quot;they
couldn't write.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy made reference to the Stone Age which
was neither seemly nor relevant, and continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you expect me to sit down and write&mdash;write
to <i>her</i>&mdash;upon such a subject as that? Write&mdash;with
a three-and-nine-penny fountain pen, on
Silurian notepaper at a shilling a packet? It's not
<i>done</i>, dear old soul; it's simply not <i>done</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy, carefully hitching up the knees of his
faultlessly creased trousers, lowered himself on to
the sofa, the picture of reproachful scorn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it takes you that way,&quot; replied the unruffled
Philip, &quot;why not use cream-laid vellum and a gold
nib?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy merely made an alarming noise at the
back of his neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or a typewriter, with the loud pedal down and
all the stops out?&quot; pursued the facetious Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Phil,&quot; announced Timothy, with a pathetic
attempt to look extremely stern and dignified,
&quot;let me tell you that I am in no mood for this sort
of thing. Dry up, man; dry up! Do you think I
could get all I have to say upon this occasion
within the limits of an ordinary letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Under the present postal regulations,&quot; explained
Philip, &quot;you can send four ounces for a
penny. In fact, if you leave the ends open&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He caught sight of Tim's tragic face, and concluded
his entertainment.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[pg&nbsp;378]</span>
&quot;Sorry, old chap!&quot; he remarked, suddenly
contrite. &quot;I don't know why one should try to pull
a man's leg on these occasions. God knows, the
business is serious enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Timothy gratefully. &quot;To tell
you the truth, I am feeling pretty bad about it.
You don't know what it is to be hard hit by a
woman, Phil.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I should have remembered that,&quot; said
Philip apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know you consider me a young blighter who
is always in love with some little piece of goods or
other,&quot; continued the chastened Timothy; &quot;but
this time it is serious. This is the end of all things.
Never before have I got sufficiently fond of a girl
to ask her to marry me; but I am going to do it
to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you luck,&quot; said Philip with feeling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks, old friend,&quot; responded the boy gratefully.
&quot;I'm in a terrible twitter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why <i>not</i> write?&quot; reiterated the methodically
minded Philip. &quot;A letter has its points, you know.
I understand that on these occasions it is a little
difficult to keep one's head. Metaphors get mixed;
telling points are omitted; and the peroration halts,
or misses fire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The feverish Timothy eyed his friend with
amazed compassion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to remind you,&quot; he observed,
&quot;that we are discussing love-letters&mdash;not election
addresses!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; said Philip pacifically; &quot;have it
your own way. All I wanted to bring home to you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>[pg&nbsp;379]</span>
was the fact that once you get your sentiments
safely down on paper, the lady is bound to get the
hang of them in the long run. On the other hand, if
you stake everything on a single verbal encounter,
you may find yourself in the tumbril. The G.P.O.
may be unromantic, but it is safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Timothy was not listening. He had put on
his greatcoat and was now adjusting a white silk
muffler.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going,&quot; he announced in trumpet tones,
&quot;to let her have it hot and strong. I'm going to
carry her off her feet. I'm going&mdash;The devil of
it all is,&quot; he added disconsolately, &quot;that one never
knows how to begin&mdash;when to chip in, in fact.
You know! One can't very well get to work while
shaking hands; there has to be a little preliminary
chit-chat of some kind. Then, the conversation
goes and settles down to some rotten, irrelevant
topic; and before you can work it round to suit
your plans the next dance strikes up, or some
criminal comes and interrupts you, or else it's time
to go home. And there you are, outside on the mat
once more, kicking yourself to death!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy cocked his silk hat upon his sleek head
with great precision, and concluded:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am going to do it to-night, or perish.
Give me five minutes in the Freeborns' conservatory
between waltzes, and she has simply got to
have it! Good-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He bounced out of the room, and was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder who the charmer is this time,&quot; mused
Philip, getting up and knocking out his pipe. &quot;I
might have asked him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[pg&nbsp;380]</span>
He rang the bell, and after a moment Mrs. Grice
glided respectfully into the room, after the manner
of a cardboard figure in a toy theatre. She
was followed by her husband, struggling with his
coat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'Ave you rang the bell, sir?&quot; queried Mrs.
Grice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Will you clear away,
please. I want that table to-night&mdash;to write at.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">During the turmoil which now ensued, Philip
sat on the padded leather fire-guard and lit another
pipe. Presently he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Grice!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Grice, engaged in a bout of what looked
like a game of catch-as-catch-can with Mr. Grice
and the tablecloth, immediately extricated herself
from her damask winding-sheet and came respectfully
to attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Grice, when you received your husband's
proposal of marriage, was it by letter or word of
mouth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Grice, needless to say, was quite overwhelmed
with maidenly confusion. Coming from
Timothy, such a question as this would have surprised
her not at all; for Timothy was one of those
fortunate persons who may say what they like to
any one. But as uttered by her grave and reserved
patron Mr. Meldrum, it sounded most alarming.
She replied, breathlessly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was you referring to Mr. Grice or to my first
'usband, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'Ow should Mr. Meldrum,&quot; enquired a husky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[pg&nbsp;381]</span>
voice from the sideboard, &quot;know you ever 'ad a
fust 'usband?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Grice, having now recovered her mental
poise, countered with a lightning thrust.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Knowing you as he does, Grice,&quot; she retorted,
&quot;is it likely Mr. Meldrum would dream of regardin'
you as my first choice?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip broke in pacifically:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us say your first husband, Mrs. Grice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sir,&quot; began Mrs. Grice readily, &quot;'e did
it by word of mouth. Leastways, not precisely.
Partly by deputy, if you take my meaning, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip made an apologetic gesture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not absolutely,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sir,&quot; continued Mrs. Grice, beginning to
enjoy herself, &quot;we'd bin walkin' out for some time,
and it didn't look like ever comin' to anything.
So my brother George, 'e said it was time the matter
was took up proper. George was a brewer's
drayman. There was eleven of us altogether!&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not <i>quite</i> so much of it!&quot; advised Mr. Grice,
who had left the sideboard to join the symposium.
&quot;Get back to your first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Needless to say, Mrs. Grice took not the slightest
notice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sir, George told me to tell 'Enery&mdash;that
bein' his name; Grice's, as you know, bein' Albert&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep to the point, do!&quot; groaned Mr. Grice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;George told me to tell 'Enery&mdash;'Enery
'Orbling his full name was&mdash;that if him and me
wasn't married inside of four weeks, George would
come along and knock his 'ead off. I told 'Enery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>[pg&nbsp;382]</span>
what George had said, sir,&quot; continued the old lady
in a tone of tender reminiscence, &quot;and I became
Mrs. 'Orbling in three weeks and six days exactly.
That's what I meant when I said that my courting
was done by deputy. 'Orbling died fourteen years
ago, in Charing Cross Hospital. His kidneys are
still&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; said Philip hurriedly. &quot;Grice, when you
asked the future Mrs. Grice to become your wife,
how did <i>you</i> set about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was you referrin', sir,&quot; enquired Mr. Grice,
with a respectful wheeze, &quot;to this Mrs. Grice or to
my first wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us say this Mrs. Grice,&quot; said Philip, beginning
to feel a little dizzy.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Grice, who had been assisting his second
choice to load glasses and spoons on to a tray, once
more desisted from his labours in order not to
confuse his brain, and began, fixing his wavering
eye upon a point on the wall just above Philip's
head:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I met 'er at a birthday party at my late first's
married sister's, sir. I gave her a motter out of a
cracker, which seemed to me to sum up what I
wanted to say in very convenient fashion, sir.
It said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>&quot;'If you love me as I love you,</i></span><br />
<span class="i2"><i>Then let's begin to bill and coo,'</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>sir. Very 'andy and compact, I thought it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what did you say to that, Mrs. Grice?&quot;
asked Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told him to give over being a silly old man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>[pg&nbsp;383]</span>
sir,&quot; replied Mrs. Grice, with extreme gratification.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And did he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir,&quot; replied the simpering Mrs. Grice.
&quot;'E <i>would</i> 'ave me! He got his way.&quot; She smiled
roguishly at her all-conquering spouse, who gave
her a look of stern reproof. &quot;Will there be anything
further, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No thank you,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Good-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His aged retainers having withdrawn, Philip
sat on, staring into the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We all have our own ways of setting about
things,&quot; he said aloud. Philip had a bad habit of
talking to himself, especially at moments of mental
concentration. When scolded by Peggy, he had
pleaded that it helped him to think. &quot;Tim's is a
personal interview in the conservatory. Grice's is
a motto out of a cracker. Mrs. Grice's is a big
brother. Mine&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He rose, and crossed the room to a locked bureau.
From this he extracted an old leather writing-case,
which had once belonged to his father. This he
laid open upon the table, beside a green-shaded
reading-lamp. After that he turned out all the
other lights and made up the fire to a cheerful
blaze. Finally, from the pocket of the writing-case
he extracted a fat envelope. It was addressed, but
not fastened. Philip drew up his chair to the table
and pulled out the contents. These comprised
many sheets, the last of which was not finished.</p>

<p class="indent">He read the letter right through, slowly and
seriously. Occasionally he made an erasure or a
correction, but not often. Then, when he reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>[pg&nbsp;384]</span>
the unfinished page, he charged his pen, squared
his elbows, uttered a heavy sigh, and addressed
himself to the labours of composition.</p>

<p class="indent">More than once he tore a page up and began
again, but finally all was finished.</p>

<p class="indent">He leaned back and read the whole epistle right
through again. Then he folded its many sheets in
their right order and put them into the envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think the occasion calls for sealing-wax,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">He found an old stump in the writing-case, and
sealed up the envelope, impressing it with his
father's seal. Presently the deed was done. The
Epistle of Theophilus lay on the table before its
author, signed, sealed, addressed, and stamped.
Philip looked at the clock, and whistled. It was
a quarter past twelve.</p>

<p class="indent">He drew aside the curtains and inspected the
night. The plate-glass window had become mysteriously
opaque; so he raised the sash&mdash;to lower it
again with all speed, coughing. A thick brown fog,
of the brand affectionately known among its
habitual inhalers as &quot;London particular,&quot; was
lying in a sulphurous pall over the choking city.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the same, my lad,&quot; decided Philip, &quot;you
had better trot out and post it. It will be delivered
at Tite Street to-morrow morning, and perhaps
some Christian person there will forward it. Perhaps
Jean Leslie will. Wish I could post myself,
too,&quot; he added wistfully. &quot;Hello, what's that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From the little lobby outside came the sharp
rat-tat of a knocker&mdash;low, clear, and rhythmical.
To judge by the sound, the outer door was standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>[pg&nbsp;385]</span>
open, and some person unknown was indulging in a
playful little tattoo.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>&quot;Officers' wives get pudding and pies,</i></span><br />
<span class="i2"><i>Soldiers' wives get skill-y!&quot;</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>it said.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip's heart almost broke from its moorings.
Hastily he picked up the shaded lamp from the
table and turned its light to illuminate the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">Next moment there came a quick and familiar
step outside. The door of the room opened gently;
and there appeared, radiant and dazzling against
the blackness behind, a Vision.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Peggy!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;just me!&quot; replied the Vision demurely.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXX" id="XXX"></a>XXX</h2>

<p class="h3">THE SILENT KNIGHT</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Peggy</span> walked to the fire and warmed her hands
delicately. She was wrapped in a dark-blue velvet
opera-cloak trimmed with fur. One corner had
fallen back, showing the pink silk lining. Presently
she slipped this garment off, and throwing it across
a chair sat down upon the padded top of the fireguard
with a contented sigh and smiled seraphically
upon her host. The clock struck half-past
twelve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy,&quot; enquired the respectable Philip severely,
&quot;what on earth are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I came to see you, Theophilus,&quot; replied Peggy.
&quot;Aren't you glad to see me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Such conduct,&quot; observed Philip resolutely,
&quot;is most reprehensible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, isn't it? But I was at a dance close by,
and I thought you would like to see my new frock.
Do you think it is pretty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip merely gaped. He was all at sea. Peggy
regarded him covertly for a moment, and spoke
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When a lady,&quot; she remarked reproachfully,
&quot;takes the trouble to climb up four flights of
stairs to show a gentleman her new frock, it is
usual for the gentleman to say something appreciative.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>[pg&nbsp;387]</span>
&quot;I think it is beautiful,&quot; said Philip, feasting his
eyes upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy, noticing this, decided to divert his attention
from the wearer to the garment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And yet,&quot; she said, &quot;if you were asked to
describe it to-morrow, you would not be able to
remember a single thing about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should remember every detail,&quot; replied
Philip, &quot;but I should not be able to describe it.
There's a difference, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Try&mdash;now,&quot; suggested Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip meekly fell in with her mood. He knew
enough of the character of the girl before him to
be quite certain that she had not visited his flat
at midnight in order to show him her new frock.
She wanted him for something: perhaps she was in
trouble. Well, she would tell him in due course.
For the moment, extenuating irrelevancies were
to be the order of the day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Peggy Falconer,&quot; he began conscientiously,
&quot;looked charming in a white silk&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Satin,&quot; corrected the charming one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;satin creation, which was partly obscured
from view by a sort of kilt&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A tunic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;a tunic, of pink gauze.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of rose-coloured <i>chiffon</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. Miss Falconer wore the neatest
little white satin shoes, tied up with ribbon, and
white silk&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are not usually mentioned.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sorry! Miss Falconer wore long white gloves&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are taken for granted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>[pg&nbsp;388]</span>
&quot;Well, anyhow,&quot; persisted the harassed Philip,
&quot;round her hair Miss Falconer wore a band of
some stuff or other&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of <i>tulle</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;of tulle, which very cleverly matched the
colour of her ki&mdash;tunic. Over her shoulders she
wore a filmy scarf, of the same stu&mdash;material.
Her waistband, which she wore rather high up,
contained a small bunch of carnations. Finally her
appearance caused considerable gratification to one
of her oldest friends, who did not know that she
was in town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only got back this afternoon,&quot; said Peggy,
who by this time had risen to her feet and was
inspecting Philip's <i>lares et penates</i>. &quot;By the way,
your front door was ajar, Philip. Your last visitor
must have left it open. Very careless! You might
have been robbed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect it was Friend Grice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy babbled on. She was speaking vivaciously,
and rather more rapidly than was her
wont; another woman would have said that she was
talking to exclude other topics.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is more than a year since I was in these
rooms, Philip. They are as snug as ever, but
horribly untidy. Why do you always keep books
on the floor? And your mantelpiece&mdash;tragic!&quot;
She ran her finger along the edge, and held it up
reproachfully. &quot;Look! Filthy!&quot; The tip of her
glove was black. &quot;I shall have to take my gloves
off, I see, to keep them clean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I apologise. You have dropped in just before
our annual dust-up. Most unfortunate!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>[pg&nbsp;389]</span>
&quot;Are these your household gods?&quot; continued
Peggy, coming to a halt before the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yours or Timothy's?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mine. Tim keeps his in the other room across
the passage. We usually feed here and sit there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy gave a little cry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Philip, when did you get those awful
vases?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip explained, with more apologies.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what is that queer thing there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a model of the Meldrum Carburettor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy nodded her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember,&quot; she said. &quot;I have met it before.
I suppose you say your prayers to it. What is in
that cracker jar?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tobacco.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought so. As for these old pipes, you ought
either to send them away to be cleaned and revarnished,
or else get a new set altogether. No, I don't
think much of your taste in mantelpiece ornaments,
Philip. Now if <i>I</i> were an eligible young bachelor,
I should sweep all these hideosities away and
substitute a row of photographs of fair ladies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid I haven't got any,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy regarded him coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed!&quot; she observed. &quot;I have an idea that
I once presented you with my portrait.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here it is,&quot; said Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">He pointed to the open bureau. There stood
Peggy's photograph, in a large round silver frame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H'm!&quot; said the original, with her head on one
side. &quot;The darkest corner of an old bureau! I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>[pg&nbsp;390]</span>
thought as much. I suppose this empty space in
the middle of the mantelpiece is reserved?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Reserved&mdash;what for?&quot; enquired the mystified
Philip.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy pointed an accusing finger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whose photograph,&quot; she enquired, &quot;does a
man eventually plant in the middle of his mantelpiece?
Hasn't she come along yet, Theophilus?
You must hustle, you know. You are getting on.
You must not be left on the shelf!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She put her head upon one side in the manner
which Philip loved, and smiled provocatively up
at her sere and yellow devotee.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, without a moment's warning, her mood
changed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philip, my friend,&quot; she said caressingly, &quot;forgive
me. You are an angel of patience. I did not
come here to-night to show you my new frock, or
torment you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had gathered that,&quot; replied Philip gravely.
&quot;Won't you sit down?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He drew up an armchair to the fire, and the girl
sank into it luxuriously, extending her flimsily
shod feet to the blaze. Philip stood with an elbow
upon the mantelpiece, looking down upon his love.
All his life he never forgot the picture that Peggy
presented at that moment&mdash;enthroned in his old
armchair in the dimly lit, smoke-laden room, in her
shimmering ball-dress, the firelight tingeing her
bare arms and shoulders, and her brown eyes and
honey-coloured hair glinting in its rays.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can I help you about anything?&quot; he asked
bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>[pg&nbsp;391]</span>
&quot;Yes, Philip, you can. I want to tell you something.
I&mdash;I have just had a proposal!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where? When?&quot; asked Philip involuntarily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At the Freeborns' dance, on the top of a flight
of stairs, about three quarters of an hour ago,&quot;
replied Peggy with great precision.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not in the conservatory?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Conservatory? No. Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had a kind of notion,&quot; said Philip lamely,
&quot;that these events always occurred in a conservatory.
You know&mdash;Chinese lanterns&mdash;distant
music&mdash;exotic atmosphere&mdash;and so on! Was it
a good proposal?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fair to middling, so far as my experience goes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he&mdash;carry you off your feet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said the girl soberly, &quot;he didn't. I
maintained my equilibrium: it's a way I have. But
you mustn't think I didn't enjoy it. It was most
thrilling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite good, in fact, for a first attempt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First attempt?&quot; Peggy's eyebrows went up.
&quot;How do you know it was a first attempt? Have
you guessed who it was?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps he told you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I have only just guessed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How upsetting of you. I wanted it to be a
surprise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is. He was dining here to-night, obviously on
the war-path, and bound for the Freeborns' dance.
But I never guessed you were the objective: I
didn't know you were in town, for one thing. So
you came here to tell me your news?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>[pg&nbsp;392]</span>
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Peggy. &quot;Not altogether,&quot; she added
slowly. &quot;I&mdash;I want to consult you, Philip. It's
a big thing for a girl to have to decide on a plunge
like this&mdash;the biggest thing she ever does. It
rather&mdash;rather frightens her at times. If she has
no mother, and no brothers or sisters, and&mdash;and
a dad like my dad, it becomes a bigger thing than
ever. Her best course, then, is to pick out the
whitest man she knows, and ask him to advise her.
That is why I am here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long silence. Then Philip said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very proud that you should have come to
me. But&mdash;but I doubt if I am the right person.
Why not ask a woman to advise you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because,&quot; replied Peggy with great vigour,
&quot;women are such born matchmakers. If you go to
a woman and confide to her that you are wobbling
on the brink of matrimony, she won't advise you:
she will simply step behind you and push you in!
That is why I can't consult Jean Leslie,&mdash;Jean
Falconer, I mean,&mdash;although she is my best friend.
She is far too romantic to say or do anything
practical. No, I must have a man, Philip; and I
have picked you. You are the best sort I know;
you have seen a good deal of life; and you are
absolutely unbiased. You know me, and you know
Tim. Now, shall I marry him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip sat down rather heavily upon the fireguard,
and pondered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I ask you two or three obvious and old-fashioned
questions?&quot; he said presently.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you&mdash;care for him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>[pg&nbsp;393]</span>
Peggy wrinkled her brow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's rather a lamb, you know,&quot; she said,
&quot;and I am fond of him. But I don't quite know
how much of it is the real thing and how much is
gratitude. I think you know&quot;&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;&quot;that
things have not always been too easy at
home&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do know!&quot; said Philip with sudden
passion. &quot;Sorry! Go on!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;And Tim could take me away from that.
He has been very good to me, always, and I
have not too many friends. I find friends rather
difficult to keep. I fancy Dad may be the reason.
You, for instance, have given us up&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip made a sudden movement, but did not
speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In fact, you have hardly been inside our
house since you left it after your illness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time Philip could answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I felt rude and churlish,&quot; he said earnestly,
&quot;but it seemed the best thing to do. You see,
one of the last observations which your esteemed
parent made to me was to the effect that he wished
to congratulate me upon having got through my
illness so inexpensively! After that&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know,&quot; said Peggy, smiling, &quot;but I need
not apologise. You know what Dad is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He furthermore added&mdash;&quot; said Philip, flushing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know what he added,&quot; interposed
Peggy quickly. &quot;He shouts, rather, when he is
making a point. And you, poor thing, being his
honoured guest, could not answer back! The fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>[pg&nbsp;394]</span>
is, the old gentleman contracted the gravest suspicions
of you the first time he found me washing
your face! (After all, some one had to do it.)
He was always inclined, too, to regard you as a
malingerer, though I kept explaining to him that
a compound fracture of the tibia could not be
simulated. Still, the long and short of it all is,
Philip, that you don't come about the house any
more. Tim does, though; apparently Dad regards
him as harmless. Tim has been very very good
to me, and as I say, I am grateful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are thinking of marrying him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frankly, I am thinking of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you have not said Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Next question, please?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are sure that Tim cares for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Peggy cheerfully, &quot;to judge by
the way he went on upon the top step, I should
call him a pretty severe case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But does he love you?&quot; persisted Philip doggedly.
&quot;A woman is always supposed to know
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Philip,&quot; assented Peggy quietly; &quot;she
usually knows.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is Tim all this time, by the way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I left him at the ball. He was particularly
anxious to have a farewell waltz with a certain
girl. You see, he is by way of burning his boats
to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is the lady?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her name is Babs Duncombe. He told me
all about her. She is one of the only other girls
he ever loved. I gather that she is about the pick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[pg&nbsp;395]</span>
of the 'also rans.' I told him he could have half
an hour to close his account with her, and then
he could come along here and call for me. There's
one o'clock striking. Now, Philip, <i>what</i> shall I
say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy's eyes met Philip's, and they were full
of appeal. But Philip asked one more question.
He thought it permissible, under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I just want to ask this,&quot; he said. &quot;Are you&mdash;sure
there is no one else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There can be no one else,&quot; she said deliberately.
&quot;Tim&mdash;and you&mdash;are the only men I
have ever known really well. There can't be any
other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She rose to her feet and stood before Philip&mdash;slim,
fragrant, and wistful&mdash;and laid her hands
on his broad shoulders. The hands were trembling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Advise me, friend,&quot; she said. &quot;I will go by
what you say. Be a big brother for a minute.
Tell me what to do. Shall I marry him? I&mdash;I'm
rather lonely, sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philip looked up into her face and all hesitation
left him. The fight within him ceased. In
its place had come the rarest and most wonderful
thing in human nature&mdash;Love that takes no
account of Self. For the moment Philip Meldrum
had ceased to be. All he saw was Peggy&mdash;Peggy
happily married and properly cared for.</p>

<p class="indent">Very gently he drew the girl's hands from his
shoulders and held them in his own. Then he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>[pg&nbsp;396]</span>
&quot;Yes&mdash;marry him. And I hope you will be
very happy, Peggy dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Philip,&quot; said Peggy quietly: one
had almost said listlessly. She was very white.
She sank down into the chair again, and Philip
released her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now,&quot; he said with great energy, &quot;I'll
go out and look for a cab for you. There's a fearful
fog outside, and there is no saying when Tim
will turn up. In any case you can't stay here till
the milkman calls. I will see if I can find some
kind of fiery chariot for you. I suppose I can't
offer you a whiskey-and-soda?&quot;&mdash;pointing to
the tray on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll take a little soda-water, please,&quot; replied
Peggy faintly.</p>

<p class="indent">She lay back gazing silently into the fire until
her host supplied her needs. Then she spoke
again, in her old steady, clear tones:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a good sort, Philip. You ought to
marry some day: you are wasted at present.
And when you pick a wife, show her to me first,
and I will see you're not imposed on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Taxi?&quot; interposed Philip, almost roughly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm not particular,&quot; said Peggy. &quot;You had
better be quick, though, because I am going to
explore this room and meddle with all your&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Philip had gone.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Presently Peggy rose to her feet and began to
wander round the room. She arrived at the bookcase.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Engineering</i>&mdash;seven bound volumes. That's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>[pg&nbsp;397]</span>
not very exciting. Rudyard Kipling&quot;&mdash;surveying
a long row: &quot;that's better. He loves him, I
know. Stevenson, Jacobs, Wells.&quot; She took down
a green volume. &quot;'The Country of the Blind.' So
<i>that's</i> where you were brought up, <i>mon ami</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy restored the book to its place with a
quavering little laugh, and turned to the table.
Then she stopped dead.</p>

<p class="indent">Before her, in the circle of light formed by the
rays of the lamp, lay a letter&mdash;a bulky letter,
ready for post. It was addressed to herself.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2>CHAPTER <a name="XXXI" id="XXXI"></a>XXXI</h2>

<p class="h3">THE ELEVENTH HOUR</p>

<p class="indent">
&quot;<i>This Week's Society Problem</i>,&quot; mused Peggy. &quot;<i>A,
an unsophisticated young spinster, finding herself alone in
the residence of B, an eligible bachelor acquaintance,
notices upon B's dining-room table a letter in B's handwriting,
addressed to herself and stamped for post.</i> Problem:
<i>What should A do?</i> Answer adjudged correct:
<i>Leave the letter where it is and wait until the postman delivers
it.</i> Answer adjudged incorrect: <i>Open the letter and
read it</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A minute later the seal was broken and Peggy
was composedly extracting the folded sheets.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid I never did have the instincts of
a real lady,&quot; she said. &quot;But perhaps the postman
would never have delivered this letter. I will
salve my conscience by picking off the stamp and
saving him a penny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did so. Then, sitting down to the table
and drawing the lamp a little nearer, she smoothed
out the crackling pages and began to read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>This is the letter of a man who suffers from an impediment
in his speech. I have been able to talk to you on many
subjects, but never on this&mdash;the thing that matters most in
all the world</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Peggy drew her chair a little closer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>I might have told you all about it long ago, the letter continued,
for I have been ready to do so ever since you gathered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>[pg&nbsp;399]</span>
me up from under the car at the foot of Wickmore Hill. But
I never did. Twice I have nearly done it, and twice I have
drawn back&mdash;the first time because it seemed too soon, the
second because it seemed no use. If details would interest
you, the first time was in the early days of my convalescence
at Tite Street. I came hobbling into your drawing-room one
afternoon&mdash;and you had been crying. I suppose your
father had been inconsiderate again. Not that you showed it,
but I happened to sit down in the same chair as your handkerchief,
which was soaking. If necessary, I can produce
the handkerchief as evidence</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Peggy gave a half-hysterical little sob.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>The second time was on Chelsea Embankment. I don't
suppose you remember</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Then followed Philip's version of what took
place on Chelsea Embankment. Peggy smiled
indulgently. She could afford to smile now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>But now that the reason which kept you from marrying
any one&mdash;and I think it was fine of you&mdash;has been removed,
I want to reopen the subject in earnest. First of all,
let me talk about the beginning of things</i>....</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Peggy looked up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder why men always want to go back
to the Year One when they make love,&quot; she mused.
&quot;Tim did it, too. I suppose it is a man's idea of
showing how firmly founded his affection is.
'Established eighteen-seventy-six'&mdash;that sort of
thing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she returned to her letter.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a lengthy epistle, this Epistle of Theophilus.
Primarily it was a love-letter; but when
you have never written a love-letter before and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[pg&nbsp;400]</span>
never intend to write another, a good deal of
secondary matter is apt to creep in. This letter
contained the whole of Philip's simple philosophy
of life; his confession of faith; the thoughts that
a deeply reserved and extremely sensitive man sets
down just once, and for one eye only. He felt
that Peggy was entitled to a full and complete
inventory of his thoughts about her; so he set
them all down, page by page, line by line; not
knowing that a woman as often as not chooses
a man as she chooses a house, not because of the
stability of the foundations or the purity of the
water-supply, but because a quaint, old-fashioned
sundial in the garden has caught her fancy, or
some oddly shaped room in an out-of-the-way
turret strikes her as the one and only site for a
little private and particular retreat of her own.
But Peggy read on.</p>

<p class="indent">The letter covered wide ground. It went back
to their first wonderful meeting, and recalled
childish conversations which Peggy thought she
had forgotten. It told of knightly dreams, and
of the Lady whom the Knight was one day to
meet and marry&mdash;not realising that he had met
her already. After that came more recent history&mdash;the
second meeting, and the rapturous convalescence
at Tite Street. The black months that
followed the tragedy on Chelsea Embankment
were sketched very lightly. Finally came the
story of the momentous voyage upon the Bosphorus,
and the race home.</p>

<p class="indent">The letter closed with a passage which need
not be set down here. This is in the main a frivolous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>[pg&nbsp;401]</span>
narrative; and there are certain inner rooms
in the human heart, from the threshold of which
self-respecting frivolity draws back with decent
reverence.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The clock struck two. Simultaneously the
outer door of the flat opened with the rattle of a
latchkey; and next moment Timothy burst into
the room. Peggy was curled up in the big armchair
before the fire, apparently half asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That you, Timmy?&quot; she enquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;dearest!&quot; replied Timothy.</p>

<p class="indent">Inflated with the enormous pride of possession,
he leaned over the back of the chair and gazed
fondly down upon his prospective bride.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't bother me just now,&quot; said Peggy.
&quot;I'm rather sleepy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Darling!&quot; responded the infatuated Timothy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop blowing on the top of my hand, and help
yourself to a cigarette, there's a good child,&quot; suggested
the darling soothingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy obeyed, a trifle dashed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't think, little girl,&quot; he remarked, lighting
the cigarette, &quot;that that is <i>quite</i> the way
in which a man expects to be greeted by his
<i>fiancée</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His what?&quot; asked Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His&mdash;well, dash it all, Peggy,&quot; exclaimed
Timothy impatiently,&mdash;he was naturally somewhat
tightly strung up to-night,&mdash;&quot;don't be a
little pig. Here I come hareing along from the
dance in search of you, as full of beans as&mdash;as&mdash;as
a&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>[pg&nbsp;402]</span>
&quot;Beanpod?&quot; suggested Peggy helpfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! Yes! All right! Beanpod, if you like!&quot;
cried the sorely tried youth. &quot;But give a fellow
a chance. As I say, here I come, red-hot on your
track, just overflowing with&mdash;well, I can't describe
it&mdash;and you greet me as if I were a Rural
Dean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should never dream of addressing a Rural
Dean as 'Timmy,' Timmy,&quot; Peggy replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you know what I mean,&quot; insisted Timothy,
not in the least appeased by this soft answer.
&quot;Just think. We have both been passing through
the greatest crisis of our lives&mdash;the most thrilling
moment of our joint existence&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have we?&quot; asked Peggy in simple wonder.
&quot;I didn't know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her incensed swain, grappling heroically with
his feelings, began to stride about the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy,&quot; he said in a stern voice, &quot;let us understand
one another clearly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For reply, the unfeeling Miss Falconer rose to
her feet and struck an attitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'<i>Tush!' cried the Marquis, pacing the floor of
the bijou boudoir liked a caged lion</i>,&quot; she recited.</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy uttered an impatient ejaculation, and
dropped upon the sofa.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Then, with a superb gesture of contempt, he
turned upon his heel and flung himself into the
depths of an abysmal divan</i>,&quot; continued Peggy.
&quot;Careful, Timmy! I heard the sofa crack.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you know, Peggy,&quot; announced
Timothy in a very ill-used voice, &quot;that you are
breaking my heart? Also destroying my faith in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>[pg&nbsp;403]</span>
women? Mere details, of course,&quot; he added, in
what was meant to be a tone of world-weary
cynicism; &quot;but they may interest you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He rose, and leaning gloomily against the mantelpiece,
glowered his disapprobation of his
beloved's ill-timed levity.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more, just as in her conversation with
Philip, Peggy flashed into another mood. She put
out an appealing hand, and touched Tim caressingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Timmy, dear,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm sorry&mdash;there!
Will you forgive me, please?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I forgive you,&quot; replied Timothy, reassuming
his air of possession at once. &quot;But it must
not occur again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; agreed Peggy meekly.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she looked at Timothy with a troubled
expression.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tim,&quot; she said, &quot;I want to talk to you like
a mother. I have been thinking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And have you come to the conclusion that
you don't love me!&quot; exclaimed Timothy in a
tragic voice. &quot;I know: don't explain! That is
a woman all over. A couple of hours&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn't going to say anything of the kind,
Tim,&quot; interposed Peggy quietly; &quot;but I have been
thinking.&quot; She fingered the buttons of Timothy's
immaculate waistcoat. &quot;I have been wondering if
a man like you <i>ought</i> to marry at present. What
lovely buttons!&quot; She played a little tune on them
to show her appreciation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't treat me like a child, please,&quot; said
Timothy stiffly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>[pg&nbsp;404]</span>
&quot;At this moment,&quot; replied Peggy, &quot;that is just
the way I am <i>not</i> treating you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think me too young, I know,&quot; insisted
Tim.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn't thinking of you at all,&quot; said Peggy
calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; said Timothy in a hollow voice. &quot;Yourself?
Quite so!&quot; He laughed sardonically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; replied Peggy patiently; &quot;of something
bigger. Something bigger than either of us. I
was thinking&mdash;well, of the nation at large.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy,&quot; enquired Timothy, entirely befogged
but considerably intrigued, &quot;what are you talking
about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down, and listen,&quot; replied Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy obeyed, and the girl continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's this way, Tim. Many a man of promise
has ruined his prospects by an early marriage.
You are a man of promise, Tim.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, rot!&quot; protested Timothy, kindling none
the less.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you were to marry now,&quot; continued Peggy,
in the same thoughtful voice, &quot;you would settle
down into a contented, domesticated husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tim nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's about time I did,&quot; he said darkly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; countered Peggy; &quot;not yet. You are a
man of action, Tim. You ought to be free, at present&mdash;free
to fight, and climb high, and become
famous&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By Jove!&quot; exclaimed Timothy, despite himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;and to reach the great place you are entitled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>[pg&nbsp;405]</span>
to. If I were a man, I would let nothing
come between me and my career. A career!
Would you sacrifice all that, Tim, just to get
married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Peggy,&quot; exclaimed Timothy, &quot;you would
help me. At least, you wouldn't be a bit in the
way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do say kind things to me, Tim,&quot; replied
Peggy gratefully. &quot;But it would never do. Even
a man of your personality would find it hard to
get on without friends and without influence;
and very young married men have few friends
and less influence. They are back numbers: nobody
wants them. It's the rising young bachelors
who go everywhere, and can command interest
and popularity and fame. A wife would be a dreadful
drag. She might make shipwreck of your life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tim drew in his breath, and was on the point of
making a gallant interjection of protest; but
Peggy concluded swiftly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you <i>must</i> establish yourself in the public
eye before you settle down. Don't you agree
with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She lay back in her chair again, looking interrogatively
up into Timothy's perplexed countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's a good deal in what you say, Peggy,&quot;
he admitted. &quot;But I simply could not leave you
in the cart, after&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden inspiration seized him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here&mdash;I have it!&quot; he cried. &quot;Supposing
we get married in five years from now&mdash;what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>[pg&nbsp;406]</span>
Peggy was silent, and Tim waited impatiently
for her to make up her mind. At last she
spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be a very difficult five years for you,
Tim. Imagine yourself going about this big world,
meeting all sorts of famous and influential people,
and growing more and more famous and influential
yourself. Girls would be falling in love with
you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I say!&quot; exclaimed Timothy, much confused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yet all the time,&quot; continued Peggy in a tragic
voice, &quot;you would be able to give them no encouragement,
because you felt bound to come at
the end of five years and marry <i>me</i>&mdash;getting on
for thirty! It wouldn't be a very comfortable
five years for either of us, would it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time Timothy was once more striding
about the room. But he was not posing now:
he was thinking hard. Peggy sat motionless.
Her face was serene, but her hands gripped the
arms of the chair until her pink finger-nails grew
white. Once she wondered where Philip was.
She did not know that he was walking up and
down Sloane Street in the fog, fighting with all the
devils in Hell.</p>

<p class="indent">At last Timothy appeared to arrive at some decision.
He came and sat down upon the edge of
Peggy's chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy,&quot; he announced, &quot;you have a sense of
proportion quite unusual in your sex. You are
the most farsighted woman I have ever known.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe I am,&quot; said Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>[pg&nbsp;407]</span>
&quot;And the most unselfish,&quot; added the youthful
Grand Turk on the arm of her chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm not so sure of that,&quot; said Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What you say about my making a career, and
all that,&quot; continued the newly awakened Timothy&mdash;&quot;well,
there is something in it, you know!
By Gad, there's something in it! I rather see
myself in Parliament, letting some of those chaps
have it in the neck! Wow-wow!&quot; He bubbled
enthusiastically: already, with the simple fervour
of the hereditary ruling class, he felt himself at
grips with the enemies of the State. &quot;And I am
sure you are right, too, about my not tying myself
down to an early marriage. I consider it a
jolly sporting and unselfish view for you to take.
Still, I must not allow you to suffer.&quot; He laid
his hand upon Peggy's arm. &quot;Look here, Peggy, if
I come to you in five years from now and ask
you to marry me&mdash;will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Peggy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cheers!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On one condition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that is&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That neither of us has married any one
else in the meanwhile,&quot; concluded Peggy sedately.</p>

<p class="indent">Timothy laughed loudly at this flight of fancy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can set your mind at rest on that point,
Peggy,&quot; he said. &quot;I will stick to you.&quot; He was
a single-minded egoist, was young Timothy.
&quot;Then it's a deal?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy, knowing well what was coming, nodded.
Timothy bent over her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>[pg&nbsp;408]</span>
&quot;I think we might signify our assent in the
usual manner&mdash;eh?&quot; he suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We agreed upon five years&mdash;not five seconds!&quot;
said Peggy, laughingly releasing her hand.
She stepped out of the chair and stood up. &quot;Now,
Tim, you trot off to the ball again; it's not much
after three. Philip will take me home: he is out
getting a cab now. You go and perform a similar
service for Babs Duncombe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I say, come!&quot; observed Timothy scornfully.
&quot;Babs Duncombe!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not? She is a very nice, pretty girl, and
her father is a very influential man. Remember,
Tim, you have got to spend the next five years
getting to know influential people. Begin on Babs.
If you hurry up, you may be able to catch her
for an extra or two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Already the pliable Timothy was putting on
his coat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right, Peggy,&quot; he said. &quot;You are
always right. I believe you know what is best
for me better than I do myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy, surveying him indulgently, mentally
allotted to him a maximum of six further months
in the single state.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shouldn't be surprised,&quot; she said. &quot;Good-night,
Tim!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night, Peggy. You are quite sure about&mdash;well,
perhaps you're right. Hallo, Theophilus,
old son! Got back?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip, putting down his hat. &quot;It's
lucky I caught you. I can't find a cab high or
low. You had better take Peggy home in yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>[pg&nbsp;409]</span>
&quot;Tim is going back to the ball, Philip,&quot; interposed
Peggy. &quot;He has one or two duty dances
to work off. I will share his cab as far as the Freeborns'
and take it on home. I shall be quite safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, hurry up, Peggy,&quot; said Timothy, now
ready for the road. &quot;I should look a bit of a mug
if I got there and found the place shut&mdash;what,
what? Good-night, Philip, my lad. Don't sit
up for me. Half a minute, Peggy! I think I had
better have a fresh pair of gloves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He dashed out, across the hall, and disappeared
into his own room, where he could be heard opening
drawers and banging cupboard doors.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip picked up Peggy's velvet cloak and
wrapped it round her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I come, too?&quot; he asked, &quot;and act as subsequent
escort; or should I find myself a member
of the ancient French family of De Trop?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy picked up her gloves, fan, and handkerchief
from the table, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You would never be <i>de trop</i> at any time,
Philip. But I am not going to drag you to Chelsea
to-night. Look&mdash;the fog is lifting!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She drew back the curtain of the window.
Twinkling lights were discernible in the street
below.</p>

<p class="indent">They shook hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you given him his answer?&quot; Philip
blurted out. He could not help it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can I&mdash;guess it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. You might. It's an even chance,
isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>[pg&nbsp;410]</span>
Timothy appeared at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peggy, I am waiting,&quot; he mentioned coldly;
and disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Coming, Tim,&quot; replied Peggy. &quot;Good-night,
Philip!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tim seems to have rather taken command
of things,&quot; said Philip, as he escorted Peggy to
the top of the stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is in a hurry, poor dear,&mdash;that's all. He
hasn't completed his evening's programme yet.
But I must fly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned to go; then paused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's as well you came in when you did, Philip,&quot;
she said. &quot;Two minutes later and you would
have found me gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad I got back in time,&quot; replied Philip
gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the girl looked up squarely into his
face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know, <i>mon ami</i>,&quot; she said, with a
whimsical smile, &quot;you have a habit of running
things rather fine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have I?&quot; replied Philip dully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have. Talk about the eleventh hour!
In&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pegg&mdash;ee!&quot; The voice of the fermenting
Timothy came booming up the staircase. Peggy
did not hurry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night&mdash;Phil!&quot; she said softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night&mdash;Pegs!&quot; replied Philip. He
touched her hand awkwardly. They had not addressed
one another thus since childhood.</p>

<p class="indent">He watched her out of sight down the winding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>[pg&nbsp;411]</span>
stair, and then turned heavily away. As he
paused to close the outer door of the flat his ear
caught the sound of light feet. He looked out.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy was standing at the top of the staircase.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Phil,&quot; she said, rather breathlessly, &quot;don't
forget to post your letter!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she fled.</p>

<p class="indent">One second later Philip was standing by the
lamplit table. His letter was gone, and another had
taken its place. It was addressed to &quot;Most Excellent
Theophilus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took it up, dizzily, and turned it over. On
the back was written:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<i>I have saved you a stamp by reading your letter before
you posted it.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>P.S. You will find the stamp on the inkstand.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Finally he opened the letter. His own had occupied
many pages; this, the answer, consisted
of three words.</p>

<p class="indent">Philip read them through. Then, rocking on
his feet, he read them again, and again. Finally
he raised his head and gazed dumbly about him.
His eyes fell upon a twinkling circular object
lying upon the table close beside the place where
he had found the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">With a swelling heart he snatched it up, and
strode to the hearthrug.</p>

<p class="indent">There, with one devastating sweep of his arm,
he rendered the mantelpiece a solitude. Everything
went with one glorious crash&mdash;pipes,
tobacco-jar, cigarettes, Bulgarian Atrocities&mdash;all.
Last, but not least, with a heavy thud, went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>[pg&nbsp;412]</span>
the Meldrum Carburettor. The day of Things
was over.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, very reverently, in the very centre of the
desert that he had created for her, he planted a
portrait&mdash;the portrait of a Lady, in a large,
round, shining, silver frame.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
